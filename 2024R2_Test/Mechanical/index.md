# Introduction

This documentation lists the APIs used in Ansys Mechanical, providing descriptions of
the objects, methods, and properties for all namespaces. The Mechanical API Documentation
contains the same information as the [ACT API Reference Guide](https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v231/en/act_script/act_script.html),
except this documentation was generated using Sphinx.

Click the [API reference](https://scripting.mechanical.docs.pyansys.com/autoapi/index.html)
link or tab in the navigation bar to explore the Mechanical API Documentation in depth.
