# Car Sound Simulator - OSC Messages

Car Sound Simulator is driven by OSC MESSAGES sent over UDP,  with each action associated with one message. The action name is a KEYWORD, followed by some OSC ARGUMENTS.

## Basic management messages

Basic management for the sound generator

## Traffic noise management

The exploiting application handles up to 8 traffic vehicles, corresponding to 8 possible synthesis slots. These 8 vehicles must be chosen by the simulator depending on their contribution to the sound scene, for example by selecting the closest ones.

Angles are in radians, 0 is a front source, -pi/2 is left, +pi/2 is right. Angles superior to pi or inferior to -pi are accepted

## Harmonic sources management

The application handles up to 10 harmonic sources. Each of them can be controlled with the following messages:

|HS\_WIDTH|ID \(int\) Value \(int\)|ID is the number of the specific harmonic source. Value is the coefficient of diffuseness of the source, between 0 and 100% \(0% means the source has no diffuseness, it can be perceived from a specific direction, 100% means the source is totally diffuse, it is perceived as surrounding and coming from all speakers with the same energy\).|

## Tires noises of the main vehicle

Tires Noise has to be updated for each wheel by providing information about the current slippyness

## Sound files playing

Supported functions:

-   sendSoundLoad : loads a sound
-   sendSoundPlay : play a sound \(looping available\)
-   sendSoundStop : stops a sound play
-   sendSoundPause : pauses a sound play
-   sendSoundVolume : sets the sound volume

There are 10 available slots for sound play in Car Sound Simulator. The main simulation application has to manage the slots indexes availability.

Notes:

-   the slots indexes are \>=1 and <=10
-   .wav extension is appended to the file name
