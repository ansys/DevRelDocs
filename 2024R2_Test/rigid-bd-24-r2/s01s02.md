The Rigid Dynamics solver uses an object-based approach that uses Python-based
commands that follow Python syntax. This section explains this approach and
the role of Python in rigid body commands. It also provides a library of
commands for Rigid Dynamics analyses (arranged by parent object) and examples
of command usage. Topics available in this section include:

An add-on is provided to facilitate the creation of complex joint and body
loads that would otherwise require using Python command snippets. You can find
information about how to load and use the add-on in online help.
