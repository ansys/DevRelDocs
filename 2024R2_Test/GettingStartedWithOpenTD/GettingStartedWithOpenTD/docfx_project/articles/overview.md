# Overview

Ansys Thermal Desktop includes all aspects of thermal model creation, including built-in finite difference, finite element, and lumped capacitance objects that can be combined into any configuration to solve complex thermal and fluid flow problems. With Thermal Desktop, users across a range of industries can build virtual prototypes to design more robust products, ranging from automotive components to crewed spacecraft.

OpenTD is an Application Programming Interface (API) for TD that allows users to automate many of the tasks currently performed interactively using TDâ€™s Graphical User Interface (GUI). OpenTD provides the tools to programmatically create, query, edit and delete models, interact with end users, run and control solutions, and manipulate results.
