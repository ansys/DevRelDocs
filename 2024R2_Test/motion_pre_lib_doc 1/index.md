The Ansys Motion Standalone Preprocessor C# Library provides a class library for users who want to automate modeling in Ansys Motion Standalone Preprocessor.

The library is divided into two main categories.

### Model Data Class Library
The Model Data Class Library is a collection of model data classes used in the actual Ansys Motion Standalone Preprocessor.

This class library allows you to access and edit the properties of all models in Ansys Motion Standalone Preprocessor.
