# Mechanical API Documentation

The following documentation examines the APIs used in Ansys Mechanical. It provides descriptions
of the objects, methods, and properties for all namespaces used in the application.

Additional documentation includes the [Scripting in Mechanical Guide](https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v241/en/act_script/act_script.html)
as well as the [ACT API Reference Guide](https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v241/en/act_ref/act_ref.html).
The scripting guide contains similar information as the reference guide but provides practical examples of how you use
the APIs in Mechanical. Whereas, the reference guide offers a complete listing of all supported APIs.
This documentation serves as a subset of the reference guide offering a focused listing of all supported APIs for Mechanical:
