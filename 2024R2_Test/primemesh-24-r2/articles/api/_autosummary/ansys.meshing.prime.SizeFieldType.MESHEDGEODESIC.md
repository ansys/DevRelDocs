# ansys.meshing.prime.SizeFieldType.MESHEDGEODESIC



#### SizeFieldType.MESHEDGEODESIC *= 7*

Computes size field using existing surface mesh sizes and diffuses geodesically. Then uses the computed size field to remesh surfaces. Notes: The type is applicable when remeshing already meshed surfaces.
