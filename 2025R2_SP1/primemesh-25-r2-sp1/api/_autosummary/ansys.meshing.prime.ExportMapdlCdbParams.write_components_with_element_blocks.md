#### *property* ExportMapdlCdbParams.write_components_with_element_blocks *: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/functions.html#bool)*

Controls whether component definitions should be written within individual element blocks. write_components_with_element_blocks only has effect when write_separate_blocks is true. When write_components_with_element_blocks is true, writes component commands for each element block. When write_components_with_element_blocks is false, writes components separately.

**This is a beta parameter**. **The behavior and name may change in the future**.
