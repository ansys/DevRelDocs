# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "DPF CPP API User's Guide"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = 2027 R1

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "C++ Interfaces for DPF 2027 R1"

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES, all static members of a file will be

# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES

# If the HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide all

# section is generated. This option has no effect if EXTRACT_ALL is enabled.
EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = NO

# The default value is: NO.

# If the HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide all
# undocumented classes that are normally visible in the class hierarchy. If set

# has no effect if EXTRACT_ALL is enabled.
# The default value is: NO.

HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES     = YES

# If the HIDE_FRIEND_COMPOUNDS tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide all friend

# If the HIDE_IN_BODY_DOCS tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide any

# The default value is: NO.

HIDE_IN_BODY_DOCS      = YES


# If the CASE_SENSE_NAMES tag is set to NO then doxygen will only generate file
# names in lower-case letters. If set to YES, upper-case letters are also
# allowed. This is useful if you have classes or files whose names only differ
# in case and if your file system supports case sensitive file names. Windows
# and Mac users are advised to set this option to NO.
# The default value is: system dependent.

CASE_SENSE_NAMES       = YES

# If the SORT_MEMBERS_CTORS_1ST tag is set to YES then doxygen will sort the
# (brief and detailed) documentation of class members so that constructors and
# destructors are listed first. If set to NO the constructors will appear in the
# respective orders defined by SORT_BRIEF_DOCS and SORT_MEMBER_DOCS.
# Note: If SORT_BRIEF_DOCS is set to NO this option is ignored for sorting brief
# member documentation.
# Note: If SORT_MEMBER_DOCS is set to NO this option is ignored for sorting
# detailed member documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

# If the SORT_GROUP_NAMES tag is set to YES then doxygen will sort the hierarchy
# of group names into alphabetical order. If set to NO the group names will
# appear in their defined order.
# The default value is: NO.

SORT_GROUP_NAMES       = YES

# If the SORT_BY_SCOPE_NAME tag is set to YES, the class list will be sorted by
# fully-qualified names, including namespaces. If set to NO, the class list will
# be sorted only by class name, not including the namespace part.
# Note: This option is not very useful if HIDE_SCOPE_NAMES is set to YES.
# Note: This option applies only to the class list, not to the alphabetical
# list.
# The default value is: NO.

SORT_BY_SCOPE_NAME     = YES

# Set the SHOW_USED_FILES tag to NO to disable the list of files generated at
# the bottom of the documentation of classes and structs. If set to YES, the
# list will mention the files that were used to generate the documentation.
# The default value is: YES.

SHOW_USED_FILES        = NO

# Set the SHOW_FILES tag to NO to disable the generation of the Files page. This

# (if specified).

SHOW_FILES             = NO

# The LAYOUT_FILE tag can be used to specify a layout file which will be parsed
# by doxygen. The layout file controls the global structure of the generated
# output files in an output format independent way. To create the layout file
# that represents doxygen's defaults, run doxygen with the -l option. You can
# optionally specify a file name after the option, if omitted DoxygenLayout.xml
# will be used as the name of the layout file.
#
# Note that if you run doxygen from a directory containing a file called
# DoxygenLayout.xml, doxygen will parse it automatically even if the LAYOUT_FILE
# tag is left empty.

# Configuration options related to the input files

# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the

# *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories.
#
# Note that for custom extensions or not directly supported extensions you also
# need to set EXTENSION_MAPPING for the extension otherwise the files are not
# read by doxygen.
#
# If left blank the following patterns are tested:*.c, *.cc, *.cxx, *.cpp,

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should be

# Note that relative paths are relative to the directory from which doxygen is
