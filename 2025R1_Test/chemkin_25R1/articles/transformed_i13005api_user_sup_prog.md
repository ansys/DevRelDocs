# Chapter 2: User Supplemental Programming

With many of the Ansys Chemkin pre-packaged Reactor Models, you have some
flexibility in modifying the behavior of the underlying programs through
supplemental programming. Many of the Reactor Models contain user-subroutine
options, which allow users to insert their own arbitrary formulations or sub-
models for describing heat transfer, inlet attributes, or time- or distance-
dependent problem constraints, such as pressure, volume, or temperature. This
chapter describes the use of this option, with particular attention to the
mechanics of recompiling the user program.

Note:  For network-license installs, users who wish to take advantage of user
programming should be sure to have a local installation of Ansys Chemkin, so
that changes do not affect other users on the system. Please see your system
administrator for assistance in setting up a local install.
