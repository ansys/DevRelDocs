    SUBROUTINE CKEQC  (T, C, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, EQK)
    Returns the equilibrium constants of the reactions given
    temperature(s) and molar concentrations.

    INPUT
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    C(*)      - Real array, concentrations of the species;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
                   cgs units, mole/cm**3
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    OUTPUT
    EQK(*)   - Real array, equilibrium constants in concentration units
                for reactions;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
                   cgs units, (mole/cm**3)**some power, depending on
                              the reaction
