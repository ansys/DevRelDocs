# Gas-phase Kinetics Sample Program (CONP)

**CONP** is an example of a FORTRAN or C++ program directly accessing the
_Gas-phase Kinetics_ Subroutine Library. Before coding such an executable for
_Gas-phase Kinetics_ , the user must (1) define a system of governing
equations, (2) define a reaction mechanism, and (3) choose a solution method.
In this sample problem we will solve the equations describing constant
pressure combustion for a hydrogen-air reaction mechanism.

The governing energy and mass conservation equations are:

| ------------------------------- | ---------- |
| ![](graphics/pgfId-1082327.svg) | **(3 -2)** |
| ---                             | ---        |

where _T_ is temperature and _Y_ k are the mass fractions of the _K_ species
involved. The independent variable _t_ is time. Other variables are
![](graphics/eq94145639-5428-9408-0097-750516216714.svg), mass density;
![](graphics/eq03264786-8361-4440-2381-340366913365.svg), mean specific heat
at constant pressure;
![](graphics/eqe2d9dbca-336f-447f-83fb-3656649736f2.svg), the specific
enthalpies of the species;
![](graphics/eq62007473-9062-9073-0608-023265774922.svg), the molar production
rates of the species; and
![](graphics/eqd20e881e-03da-47eb-95f2-0e8935b5cd71.svg), the molecular
weights of the species.

The governing system of ordinary differential equations and accompanying
initial conditions form an initial value problem. The equations will be solved
using VODE.[1] We find this solver to be reliable for the solution of a wide
range of stiff initial-value problems. The source code for the solver is
provided in the Chemkin subdirectory _source_public\vode.f_ (PC),
_source_public/vode.f_ (UNIX), which is extensively commented as to its
implementation.

The FORTRAN implementation for the solution of the sample problem is provided
in the Ansys Chemkin subdirectory _samples
<release_number>\sample_apps_f77\conp_ (PC), _samples
<release_number>/sample_apps_f77/conp_ (UNIX), and a C++ implementation in
_samples <release_number>\sample_apps_cpp\conp_ (PC), _samples
<release_number>/sample_apps_cpp/conp_ (UNIX). After initializing _Gas-phase
Kinetics_ , the program reads the initial nonzero moles from input. It then
repeatedly calls subroutine `VODE` to obtain the solution at uniform print
intervals. The governing equation formulation is found in `SUBROUTINE FUN`,
which is called by `VODE`.

**Note:**   When using this example, you must (i) ensure FLEXLM_ARCH is set
(see [Recompiling and Linking a User Subroutine](i71111.md "2.1.3.
Recompiling and Linking a User Subroutine") ) and (ii) edit the .inc makefile
so that the CKROOT variable is set to the location of your Ansys Chemkin
installation (see [Compile and Link](pgfId-1085750.md#i60052 "3.1.1.6.
Compile and Link") ).
