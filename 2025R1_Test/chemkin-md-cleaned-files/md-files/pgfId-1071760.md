# Mnemonics

There are some rules of thumb for explaining the subroutine naming
conventions. All subroutine names begin with the letters `SK` so that Surface
Kinetics Subroutines are easily recognized and so that they are likely
different from any user subroutine names. The four remaining letters generally
identify the purpose of the subroutine.

Thermodynamic properties are referred to by `CP` (specific heat), `H` (
enthalpy), `S` ( entropy), `U` ( internal energy), `G` (Gibbs free energy),
and `A` (Helmholtz free energy). The thermodynamic property subroutines may be
called to return properties in mass units, denoted by `MS` or `S` as the last
letter(s), or in molar units, denoted by `ML` or `L` as the last letter(s).

The mnemonics for the variable names in the subroutine call lists are roughly
the same as for the subroutine names.
