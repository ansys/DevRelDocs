    SUBROUTINE CKPC   (T, C, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, P)
    Returns the pressure of the gas mixture given
    temperature(s) and molar concentrations.

    INPUT
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    C(*)      - Real array, concentrations of the species;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
                   cgs units, mole/cm**3
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    OUTPUT
    P         - Real scalar, pressure.
                   cgs units, dynes/cm**2
