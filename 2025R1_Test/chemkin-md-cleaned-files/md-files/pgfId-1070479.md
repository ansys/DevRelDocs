    SUBROUTINE MCCCEX (K, RMCWRK, COFCON)
    Gets or puts values of the fitting coefficients for the
    polynomial fits to species conductivity.

    INPUT
    K         - Integer scalar, species index.
                K > 0 gets coefficients from RMCWRK
                K < 0 puts coefficients into RMCWRK
    RMCWRK(*) - Real workspace array; dimension at least LENRMC.

    If K < 1:
    COFCON    - Real vector of polynomial coefficients for
                the species' conductivity; dimension at least NO,
                usually 4.

    OUTPUT
    If K > 1:
    COFCON    - Real vector of polynomial coefficients for
                the species' conductivity; dimension at least NO,
                usually 4.
