    SUBROUTINE SKSML  (T, ISKWRK, RSKWRK, SML)
    Returns an array of the standard state entropies in molar units.

    INPUT
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    ISKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENISK.
    RSKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRSK.

    OUTPUT
    SML(*)    - Real array, standard state entropies for the species;
                dimension at least KKTOT, the total species count.
                   cgs units, ergs/(mole*K)
