    SUBROUTINE CKFALP (P, T, X, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, I, RKLOW, CTB, PR, FC,
                       PCOR)
    Returns details concerning the reaction rate constant for
    pressure-dependent reactions.

    INPUT
    P      - Pressure.
                  cgs units - dynes/cm**2
                  Data type - real scalar
    T(*)   - Temperature array.
                  cgs units - K
                  Data type - real vector
    X      - Mole fractions of the species.
                  cgs units - none
                  Data type - real array
                  Dimension X(*) at least KK, the total number of
                  species.
    ICKWRK - Array of integer workspace.
                  Data type - integer array
                  Dimension ICKWRK(*) at least LENIWK.
    RCKWRK - Array of real work space.
                  Data type - real array
                  Dimension RCKWRK(*) at least LENRWK.

    OUTPUT
    RKLOW    - Low Pressure forward reaction rate for pressure-
               dependent reactions. It is defined to be zero for
               non-pressure-dependent reactions.
                  cgs units - 1/(sec) *
                          (cm**3/mole)**(sum of forward stoich. coeff)
                  Data type - real
    CTB      - Effective concentration for reaction, I_SAVE.
               This takes into account the effectiveness factors
               for the reaction, applicable to third body
               and pressure-dependent reactions.  It is defined to be
               equal to the total concentration for other pressure-
               dependent or third body reactions, and to be equal to
               one for reactions which don't use it
               Units are moles/cm**3.
                  cgs units - mole/(cm**3)
                  Data type - real
    PR       - Reduced Pressure for pressure-dependent reactions.
               This is defined to be equal to CTB*RKLOW_SAVE/RCF_INF.
               where RCF_INF is the high pressure rate constant.
               This is a dimensionless quantity.  For non-pressure-
               dependent reactions, this quantity is defined to be 0.
                  cgs units - unitless
                  Data type - real
    FC       - Correction to L-H rate constant for pressure-dependent
               reactions.  It is defined to be 0 for non-pressure-
               dependent reactions.
                  cgs units - unitless
                  Data type - real
    PCOR     - This is equal to the pressure correction ratio for
               pressure-dependent reactions, that is, RC(T,P) / RC(T)_inf
               the ratio of the actual reaction rate to the high
               pressure reaction rate constant.
                  cgs units - unitless
                  Data type - real array
