# Prerequisite Skills

We presume that a user is familiar with the rudiments of setting environment
and path variables; the basic Ansys Chemkin requirements in that regard are
adequately provided by the README files, with further extensive information
and tutorial sessions in [Chemkin Getting Started Guide](.../../chemkin_gs/chemkin_gs.md . It is further presumed that a user-
programmer is familiar with the fundamentals of using the compiler, linker,
and make processes of the platform. The Chemkin Application Programming
Interface documentation is not designed to provide detailed information on
those processes, only on how to use them with Chemkin programs and libraries.
