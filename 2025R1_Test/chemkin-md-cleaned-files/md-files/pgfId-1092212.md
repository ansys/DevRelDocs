    SUBROUTINE CKCDYR (RHO, T, Y, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, CDOT, DDOT)
    Returns the molar creation and destruction rates of the species
    given mass density, temperature(s) and mass fractions.

    INPUT
    RHO       - Real scalar, mass density.
                   cgs units, gm/cm**3
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    Y(*)      - Real array, mass fractions of the mixture;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    OUTPUT
    CDOT(*)   - Real array, chemical creation rates of the species;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
                   cgs units, mole/(cm**3*sec)
    DDOT(*)   - Real array, chemical destruction rates of the species;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
                   cgs units, moles/(cm**3*sec)
