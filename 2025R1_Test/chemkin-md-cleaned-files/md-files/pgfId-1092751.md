    SUBROUTINE CKCVBS (T, Y, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, CVBMS)
    Returns the mean specific heat at constant volume in mass units.

    INPUT
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    Y(*)      - Real array, mass fractions of the mixture;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    OUTPUT
    CVBMS     - Real scalar, mean specific heat at constant volume.
                   cgs units, ergs/(gm*K)
