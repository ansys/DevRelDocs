    SUBROUTINE CKIXSM (ICKWRK, IXSM, IXSK)
    Returns a set of flags indicating whether the reactions are ion
    momentum-transfer cross sections.

    INPUT
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.

    OUTPUT
    IXSM(*)   - Integer array, ion momentum-transfer cross-section flag;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
                IXSM(I)= -1  reaction I is not a ion mom-transfer x-sec
                IXSM(I)=  KI reaction I is a ion mom-trans cross-section
                          and KI is the ion species index
    IXSK(*)   - Integer array, species indices for the collision partner
                of the ion momentum-transfer cross-section reactions;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
