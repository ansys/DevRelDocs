Note this subroutine will calculate a value for the reverse rate constant irrespective of whether the reaction was deemed reversible in the Pre-processor file. Also note that the concentration of third bodies for third body reactions is included in the returned rate constant. The units for the rate constant will depend on the number of reactants. |
