    SUBROUTINE SKGML  (T, ISKWRK, RSKWRK, GML)
    Returns an array of the standard state Gibbs free energies
    in molar units. Does not account for dependence on surface coverage (HFCOV). To include that effect, use subroutine SKCGML.

    INPUT
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    ISKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENISK.
    RSKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRSK.

    OUTPUT
    GML(*)    - Real array, standard state Gibbs free energies
                for the species;
                dimension KKTOT, the total species count.
                   cgs units, ergs/mole
