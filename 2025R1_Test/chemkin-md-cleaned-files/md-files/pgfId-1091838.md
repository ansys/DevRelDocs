    SUBROUTINE CKABE  (ICKWRK, RCKWRK, RA, RB, RE)
    Returns the Arrhenius coefficients of the reactions.

    INPUT
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    OUTPUT
    RA(*)     - Real array, pre-exponential constants for reactions;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
                   cgs units, mole-cm-sec-K
    RB(*)     - Real array, temperature dependence exponents for
                reactions;
                dimension at least II, total reaction count.
                   cgs units none
    RE(*)     - Real array, activation energies for reactions;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
                   cgs units, K
