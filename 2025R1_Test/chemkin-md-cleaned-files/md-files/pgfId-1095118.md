    SUBROUTINE CKSBML (P, T, X, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, SBML)
    Returns the mean entropy of the mixture in molar units given
    pressure, temperature(s) and mole fractions.

    INPUT
    P         - Real scalar, pressure.
                  cgs units, dynes/cm**2
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    X(*)      - Real array, mole fractions of the mixture;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    OUTPUT
    SBML      - Real scalar, mean entropy.
                   cgs units, ergs/(mole*K)
