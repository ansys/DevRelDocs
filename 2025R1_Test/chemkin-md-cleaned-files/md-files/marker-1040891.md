# Overview of Utilities Packages

CHEMKIN is highly structured and modular, consisting of three basic utilities
packages:  Gas Kinetics, Surface Kinetics, and Transport. Gas Kinetics forms
the core set of utilities, upon which the other two depend. Use of these
utilities requires the manipulation of a number of programs, subroutines, and
data files. This section describes the structure of the Gas-phase Kinetics
package and the basic requirements for using it from within your own
application programs. [Structure and Use of the Surface Kinetics Utilities](ppgfId-1017373.md"1.5. Structure and Use of the Surface Kinetics
Utilities") provides similar information for the Surface Kinetics utilities,
while [Structure and Use of the Transport Utilities](pgfId-1021250.md "1.6.
Structure and Use of the Transport Utilities") providpgfId-1021250.mdf the
Transport utilities.
