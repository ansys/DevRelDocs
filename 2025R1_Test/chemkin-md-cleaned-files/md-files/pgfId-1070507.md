    SUBROUTINE MCCDEX (K, KDIM, RMCWRK, COFDIF)
    Gets or puts values of the fitting coefficients for the
    polynomial fits to species binary diffusion coefficients.

    INPUT
    K         - Integer scalar, species index.
                K > 0 gets coefficients from RMCWRK
                K < 0 puts coefficients into RMCWRK
    KDIM      - First dimension for COFDIF matrix;
                KDIM should be at least KK, the total number of species
    RMCWRK(*) - Real workspace array; dimension at least LENRMC.

    If K < 1:
    COFDIF    - Real matrix of polynomial coefficients for
                the species' binary diffusion coefficient with all
                other species; the first dimension is KDIM,
                which should be at least KK, the total number of species;
                the second dimension should be at least NO, usually 4

    OUTPUT
    If K > 1:
    COFDIF    - Real matrix of polynomial coefficients for
                the species' binary diffusion coefficient with all
                other species; the first dimension is KDIM,
                which should be at least KK, the total number of species;
                the second dimension should be at least NO, usually 4
