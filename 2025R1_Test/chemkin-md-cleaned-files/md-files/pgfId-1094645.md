    SUBROUTINE CKQC   (T, C, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, Q)
    Returns the rates of progress for reactions given temperature(s)
    and molar concentrations.

    INPUT
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    C(*)      - Real array, concentrations of the species;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
                   cgs units, mole/cm**3
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    OUTPUT
    Q(*)      - Real array, rates of progress for reactions;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
                   cgs units, moles/(cm**3*sec)
