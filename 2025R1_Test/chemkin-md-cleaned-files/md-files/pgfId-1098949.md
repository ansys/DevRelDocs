    SUBROUTINE CKCTY  (C, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, Y)
    Returns the mass fractions given molar concentrations.

    INPUT
    C(*)      - Real array, concentrations of the species;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
                   cgs units, mole/cm**3
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    OUTPUT
    Y(*)      - Real array, mass fractions of the mixture;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
