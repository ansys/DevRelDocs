    SUBROUTINE CKRAEX (I, RCKWRK, RA)
    Get/put the Pre-exponential coefficient of the Ith reaction

    INPUT
    I         - Integer scalar, reaction index;
                I > 0 gets RA(I) from RCKWRK
                I < 0 puts RA(I) into RCKWRK
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    If I < 1:
    RA        - Real scalar, pre-exponential coefficient for reaction I.
                   cgs units, mole-cm-sec-K

    OUTPUT
    If I > 1:
    RA        - Real scalar, pre-exponential coefficient for reaction I.
                   cgs units, mole-cm-sec-K
