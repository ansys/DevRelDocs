    SUBROUTINE SKAMS  (T, ISKWRK, RSKWRK, AMS)
    Returns an the standard state Helmholtz free energies in mas units. Does not account for dependence on surface coverage (HFCOV). To include that effect, use subroutine SKCAMS. 

    INPUT
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    ISKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENISK.
    RSKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRSK.

    OUTPUT
    AMS(*)    - Real array, standard state Helmholtz free energies
                for species;
                dimension at least KKTOT, the total species count.
                   cgs units, ergs/gm
