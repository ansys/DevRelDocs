    SUBROUTINE CKHBML (T, X, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, HBML)
    Returns the mean enthalpy of the mixture in molar units.

    INPUT
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    X(*)      - Real array, mole fractions of the mixture;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    OUTPUT
    HBML      - Real scalar, mean enthalpy.
                     cgs units - ergs/mole
