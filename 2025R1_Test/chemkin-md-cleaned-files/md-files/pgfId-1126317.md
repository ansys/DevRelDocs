# Surface Kinetics Sample Program (SKSAMPLE)

SKSAMPLE is an example FORTRAN program for directly accessing the Surface
Kinetics Subroutine Library. The problem that we have chosen for the example
involves the time-dependent deposition of a solid film on the surfaces of a
fixed-volume, fixed-temperature container that was initially filled with a gas
mixture.

One of the first tasks is to derive a system of equations that describes the
process to be simulated. Here, the first equation involves the conservation of
mass in the container:

| ![../../output2/graphics/pgfId-1080135.svgvg) | (3-3) |
| ------------------------------- | ----- |

where ![](../../output2/graphics/eq90bd8d54-abbd-449c-84e4-a8b2be916355.svg) is time,
![](../../output2/graphics/eq102cbc4a-ccc2-4b5c-a897-59f688f80015.svg) is the mass of gas-
phase species ![](../../output2/graphics/eq5b3ec680-ee1f-4d15-bf70-6f765679508e.svg) in the
container, ![](../../output2/graphics/eq693dd893-1aa0-40bd-afb3-e603eb24c8da.svg) is the
container volume,![](../../output2/graphics/eq30872893-5952-5117-8225-867420063838.svg) is
the molar production (destruction) rate of gas-phase species by gas-phase
chemical reactions, ![](../../output2/graphics/eqaa65409a-29b8-4090-a133-8531b7aa9f69.svg)
are the species molecular weights,
![](../../output2/graphics/eqf5c7a138-d164-435c-bd6e-65d87bd26fee.svg) is the container-wall
surface area, and ![](../../output2/graphics/eq35347292-3805-0415-0160-109773348712.svg) is
the molar production rate of gas-phase species by surface reactions. After
introducing the gas-phase mass density
![](../../output2/graphics/eq48500687-4074-7400-6084-505550119112.svg) (where
![](../../output2/graphics/eqb596b963-f51a-4c9f-a9dc-b0abfedc00f1.svg) is the total gas-
phase mass) and the gas-phase species mass fractions
![](../../output2/graphics/eq33753323-2102-8177-4314-724765120672.svg), some manipulation
leads to the following equation:

| ![../../output2/graphics/pgfId-1080179.svgvg) | (3-4) |
| ------------------------------- | ----- |

The total mass in the gas phase depends on the production (destruction) of
gas-phase species by surface reaction, as stated by

| ![../../output2/graphics/pgfId-1080184.svgvg) | (3-5) |
| ------------------------------- | ----- |

We rewrite this equation slightly to make
![](../../output2/graphics/eq27878385-6900-1426-0394-637900994082.svg) a dependent variable
and use the area-to-volume
![](../../output2/graphics/eq17372311-4896-2333-4000-425140588590.svg) as a parameter:

| ![../../output2/graphics/pgfId-1080195.svgvg) | (3-6) |
| ------------------------------- | ----- |

On the surface, the number of moles of species
![](../../output2/graphics/eq99f42b89-fd39-44fc-b632-be0490a0943a.svg) is given by

| ![../../output2/graphics/pgfId-1080203.svgvg) | (3-7) |
| ------------------------------- | ----- |

where ![](../../output2/graphics/eq171e77ce-3478-44da-b3d1-3634f88ea170.svg) is the site
fraction of species ![](../../output2/graphics/eqe2fca669-ba20-4f73-8947-131870f5e6e1.svg)
on surface site ![](../../output2/graphics/eq1e9994c6-152e-4395-866b-cd0c05256be9.svg)
(fraction of sites occupied by species
![](../../output2/graphics/eqa3cb9a36-06b9-429e-960c-3267f34005f1.svg) in phase
![](../../output2/graphics/eqffea94ed-4b38-467c-8f37-37b88bb61d4b.svg)),
![](../../output2/graphics/eq92401940-9538-4780-1106-870534929156.svg) is the density of
sites in phase ![](../../output2/graphics/eqbecd06a5-2268-41e3-96dd-8546fc7e6a90.svg) (in
mole/cm2), and ![](../../output2/graphics/eq59010999-1591-3899-4556-926796331858.svg) is the
number of sites that species
![](../../output2/graphics/eq08ea1f7d-6c45-43c8-a76c-9aec9bf6ba1c.svg) occupies. The molar
production (destruction) rate of surface species
![](../../output2/graphics/eq4a975373-97f9-4952-8da4-a5d222ba188e.svg) by surface reaction
is stated as

| ![../../output2/graphics/pgfId-1080241.svgvg) | (3-8) |
| ------------------------------- | ----- |

In terms of site fractions
![](../../output2/graphics/eq8d46359c-e88b-4f7a-80a8-39ccbeaf4892.svg), the equation
governing the surface species is given as

| ![../../output2/graphics/pgfId-1080249.svgvg) | (3-9) |
| ------------------------------- | ----- |

where the last term can be dropped if the number of surface sites if fixed.
When surface reactions create or destroy sites, then a conservation equation
is included for the site densities of each phase
![](../../output2/graphics/eq7bdbc1b5-1b9a-4da3-a72b-d48b75c9cf5f.svg):

| ![../../output2/graphics/i54532.svgvg) | (3-10) |
| ------------------------ | ------ |

However, our sample mechanism conserves sites, so the time derivative in
[Equation 3-10](pgfId-1126317.md#i54532 "(3–10)") is trivially zero.

The governing system of ordinary differential equations and accompanying
initial conditions form an initial value problem. The equations will be solved
using the software VODE.[Equation 3-1](pgfId-1085459.md#pgfId-1082323 "(3–1)") We find this software to be reliable for the solution of a wide
range of stiff initial-value problems.

The FORTRAN program sksample.f for the solution of the sample problem is
provided in the Ansys Chemkin user area subdirectory
samples<release_number>\sample_apps_f77\sksample (PC),
samples<release_number>/sample_apps_f77/sksample (UNIX). After initializing
the Gas-phase Kinetics Subroutine Library and the Surface Kinetics Subroutine
Library, the program reads the initial nonzero moles from input. It then
repeatedly calls subroutine VODE to obtain the solution at uniform print
intervals. The governing equation formulation is found in SUBROUTINE FUN,
which is called by VODE.

Note:  When using this example, you must (i) ensure FLEXLM_ARCH is set (see
[Recompiling and Linking a User Subroutine](i71111.md "2.1.3. Recompiling
and Linking a User Subroutine") ) and (ii) ei71111.mdinc makefile so that the
CKROOT variable is set to the location of your Ansys Chemkin installation (see
[Compile and Link](pgfId-1085750.md#i60052 "3.1.1.6. Compile and Link") ).
