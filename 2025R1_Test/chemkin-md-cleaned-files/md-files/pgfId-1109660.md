    SUBROUTINE SKRATI (IR, ROP, ISKWRK, RSKWRK, SDOTI, SITDTI)
    Returns rates of production of the species by surface reaction IR.

    INPUT
    IR        - Integer scalar, reaction index;
    ROP(*)    - Real array, rates of progress for the surface reactions;
                dimension at least IISUR, the total surface reaction
                count.
                   cgs units, moles/(cm**2*sec).
    ISKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENISK.
    RSKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRSK.

    OUTPUT
    SDOTI(*)  - Real array, production rates of the species by reaction
                IR;
                dimension at least KKTOT, the total species count.
                   cgs units, moles/(cm**2*sec)
                for 1,KKGAS, the production rate of gas-phase species,
                for KKGAS+1,KKGAS+KKSUR, the production rate of surface
                species,
                for KKGAS+KKSUR+1,KKTOT, the production rate of bulk
                species.
    ITDTI(*)  - Real array, production rates of the surface phases due to
                reaction IR;
                dimension at least NPHASE, the total phase count, but
                subroutine calculates entries only for site phases.
                   cgs units, moles/(cm**2*sec)
