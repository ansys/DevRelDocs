# Example of Using the Surface Kinetics Pre-processor

We illustrate the use of Surface Kinetics by a simple example involving
deposition of silicon. The surface reaction mechanism is shown in [Example 1.5: Sample Reaction Mechanism as Read by the Surface Kinetics Pre- processor](pgpgfId-1020396.md#i40383Example 1.5: Sample Reaction Mechanism
as Read by the Surface Kinetics Pre-processor") as it appears for the input
file to the Surface Kinetics Pre-processor. The first two lines identify a
site type called `SILICON` that has a site density of 1.66 × 10-9 mole/cm2.
Only one species, SI(S), exists on this site type. The bulk material is
identified as SI(B), and it has a mass bulk density of 2.33 g/cm3. This is a
very simple example that has only one site type occupied by only one species
and only one pure bulk material. In general, however, an input file could
specify many different site types, each of which could be occupied by a
variety of species. Furthermore, there could be several bulk-phase mixtures
that could each be composed of several species. Examples of all these
possibilities appear in the [Chemkin Input Manual](../chemkin_in/chemkin_in.md) Input Manual.

The reaction mechanism itself is listed next. The sy../../chemkin_in/chemkin_in.md
expression indicates that all of the reactions are irreversible. The three
numbers following each reaction expression are its Arrhenius rate parameters (
pre-exponential factor, temperature exponent, and activation energy).

All of the reactions in this mechanism have the same form: a gas-phase species
reacting on a silicon site. The reaction of silane at the surface is
illustrated in [Figure 1.4: Illustration of Gas-Phase Silane Reaction](pgfId-1020396.md#i30411 "Figure 1.4: Illustration of Gas-Phase
Silane Reaction") . Each silicon-containing gas-phase species can react on an
atomic surface site, SI(S), to deposit a silicon atom as SI(B) and release
hydrogen back into the gas phase. We have included SI(S) as both a reactant
and a product to indicate that a "site" must be available at which the gas-
phase species can react. In the example, however, the surface silicon SIpgfId-1020396.md#i30411
distinguished from the bulk deposit SI(B) by virtue of its position as the
top-most atom at the surface. Therefore, each time a SI(S) is consumed by a
reaction the bulk layer becomes one atom thicker and the silicon atom that
just left the gas now forms the top-most surface layer, that is, SI(S). For
this mechanism, the SI(S) could have been just as well left out of the
mechanism entirely. However, if other gas-phase species had been present (say
phosphine carrying phosphorus as a dopant), these species could compete for
the available silicon sites on the surface. Thus, by writing the reactions as
we have, we have left open the possibility for other species to occupy surface
sites and thus inhibit the deposition of silicon.

As an example of the full use of Surface Kinetics, assume that the program we
are writing needs to evaluate a boundary condition concerning the energy
balance at a surface of an isothermal particle.

The energy balance would take the following form (with the surface normal
![](graphics/eq49317123-2176-3484-4931-033635321250.svg) pointing into the
particle):

The surface site fractions and the bulk-species activities are also dependent
variables, but do not appear explicitly in the expression. The first term in
this equation describes thermal conduction to the surface from the gas phase.

Example 1.6: Example calls to the Surface Kinetics Subroutine Library
../../output2/graphics/eq79624287-1510-6777-1481-332300794039.svg


    CALL SKINIT(LSIWK, LSRWK, LSCWK, LINKSK, LOUT, ISKWRK, RSKWRK, CSKWRK, IFLAG)
    CALL SKWT(ISKWRK, RSKWRK, WT)
    CALL SKHMS(T, ISKWRK, RSKWRK, HMS)
    CALL SKRAT(P, T, ACT, SDEN, ISKWRK, RSKWRK, SDOT, SITDOT)

The complete details for these calls are explained in later chapters of this
manual; the objective here is to illustrate the relative simplicity of writing
an Ansys Chemkin program. Briefly, the first call is to the initialization
subroutine `SKINIT`, which reads the Surface Kinetics Linking File created by
the Surface Kinetics Pre-processor and populates the three work arrays.
`LSIWK`, `LSRWK`, and `LSCWK` are the dimensions provided by the user for the
data arrays `ISKWRK`, `RSKWRK`, and `CSKWRK`. `LINKSK` is the logical file
number of the Surface Kinetics Linking File, `LOUT` is the logical file number
for printed diagnostic and error messages, and `IFLAG` is an integer error
flag. In the remaining calls, `P` and `T` are the pressure and temperature.
The array `ACT` contains the gas-phase mole fractions, the surface site
fractions, and the bulk species activities, in that order. The output variable
arrays, `HMS` and `SDOT`, correspond to the factors in the summation from
[Equation 1-3](pgfId-1020396.md#i61143 "(1–3)") , that is, `HMS` =
![](graphics/eq19135887-8623-2438-8563-132844781676.svg), and `SDOT` =
![](graphics/eq33719021-8375-1353-5972-733423400408.svg).

The FORTRAN representation of the summation in the last term, given by
combining the results of the above subroutine calls, is simply

The species indices `FIRST_SURFACE_SPECIES` and `LAST_BULK_SPECIES` are also
available from a call to the Surface Kinetics Subroutine Library.
