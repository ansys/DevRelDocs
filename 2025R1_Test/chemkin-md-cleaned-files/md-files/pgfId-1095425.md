    SUBROUTINE CKTHB  (KDIM, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, AKI)
    Returns matrix of enhanced third body coefficients.

    INPUT
    KDIM      - Integer scalar, first dimension of the matrix AKI;
                KDIM must be at least KK, the total species count.
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    OUTPUT
    AKI(*,*)  - Real matrix, enhanced third body efficiencies of the
                species in the reactions;
                dimension at least KK for first, the total species count,
                and at least II for the second, the total reaction count.
                AKI(K,I) is the enhanced efficiency of species K in
                reaction I.
