    SUBROUTINE CKNPAR (LINE, NPAR, LOUT, IPAR, ISTART, KERR)
    Searches a character string LINE from last to first character,
    to create a substring IPAR containing NPAR blank-delimited numbers;
    ISTART is the column of LINE containing IPAR. This allows format-
    free input of combined alpha-numeric data.  For example,

       input:  LINE*80   = "t1 t2 dt  300.0  3.0E3  50"
               NPAR      = 3, the number of substrings requested
               LOUT      = 6, a logical unit number on which to write
                           diagnostic messages.
       output: IPAR*80   = "300.0  3.0E3  50"
               ISTART    = 13, the starting column in LINE of the
                           NPAR substrings
               KERR      = .FALSE.

    INPUT
    LINE      - Character string; length determined by calling routine.
    NPAR      - Integer scalar, number of substrings expected.
    LOUT      - Integer scalar, output unit for printed diagnostics.

    OUTPUT
    IPAR      - Character string, subset of LINE, containing only the
                NPAR substrings.
    ISTART    - Integer scalar, starting location in LINE of the NPAR
                substrings.
    KERR      - Logical, character length or syntax error flag.
