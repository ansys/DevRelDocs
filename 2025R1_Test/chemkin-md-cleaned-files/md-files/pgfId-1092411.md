    SUBROUTINE CKCPML (T, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, CPML)
    Returns the specific heats at constant pressure in molar units.

    INPUT
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    OUTPUT
    CPML(*)   - Real array, specific heats at constant pressure for
                the species;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
                   cgs units, ergs/(mole*K)
