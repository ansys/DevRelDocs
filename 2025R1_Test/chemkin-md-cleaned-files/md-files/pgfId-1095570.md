    SUBROUTINE CKWL   (ICKWRK, RCKWRK, WL)
    Returns a set of flags providing information on the wave length
    of photon radiation

    INPUT
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    OUTPUT
    WL(*)     - Real array, radiation wavelengths for reactions;
                dimension at least II, total reaction count.
                   cgs units, angstrom.
                WL(I)= 0.  reaction I does not have radiation as
                           either a reactant or product
                WL(I)=-A   reaction I has radiation of wavelength A
                           as a reactant
                WL(I)=+A   reaction I has radiation of wavelength A
                           as a product
                If A = 1.0 then no wavelength information was given;
