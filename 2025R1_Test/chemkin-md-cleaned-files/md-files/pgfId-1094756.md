    SUBROUTINE CKR2CH (RNUM, STR, I, KERR)
    Returns a character string representation of a real number
    and the effective length of the string.

    INPUT
    RNUM      - Real scalar, to be converted to a string;
                the maximum magnitude of RNUM is machine-dependent.

    OUTPUT
    STR      - Character string, left-justified representation of RNUM;
               that is, RNUM=  0.0      returns STR=" 0.00"
                     RNUM= -10.5     returns STR="-1.05E+01"
                     RNUM= 1.86E-100 returns in STR=" 1.86E-100"
                     the minimum length of STR required is 5
    I        - Integer scalar, total non-blank characters in RNUM.
    KERR     - Logical, character length error flag.
