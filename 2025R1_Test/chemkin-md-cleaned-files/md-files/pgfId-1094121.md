    SUBROUTINE CKKFRT (P, T, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, RKFT, RKRT)
    Returns the forward and reverse reaction rates for reactions
    given pressure and temperature(s)

    INPUT
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    OUTPUT
    RKFT(*)   - Real array, forward reaction rates for reactions;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
                   cgs units, depends on the reaction
    RKRT(*)   - Real array, reverse reaction rates for reactions;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
                   cgs units, depends on the reaction
