Table 6.2: Viscosity Subroutines

| Subroutine                           | Description                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `SUBROUTINE MCSVIS (T, RMCWRK, VIS)` | This subroutine computes the array of |
pure species viscosities given the temperature.  
`SUBROUTINE MCAVIS (T, X, RMCWRK, VISMIX)`| This subroutine computes the
mixture viscosity given the temperature and the species mole fractions. It
uses modifications of the Wilke semi-empirical formulas.  
`SUBROUTINE MCCVEX (K, KDIM, RCKWRK, COFVIS)` | Gets or puts values of the fitting coefficients for the polynomial fits to species viscosity.
