    SUBROUTINE SKNU   (IDIM, ISKWRK, RSKWRK, KSTOIC, NSTOIC)
    Returns the stoichiometric coefficients of the species and the net
    change in phases for all of the surface reactions in a mechanism.
    
    INPUT
    IDIM      - Integer scalar, first dimension of the array NSTOIC;
                must be at least IISUR, the total surface reaction count.
    ISKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENISK.
    RSKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRSK.
    
    OUTPUT
    KSTOIC(*,*)-Integer matrix, stoichiometric coefficients for the
                species in the surface reactions;
                the first dimension must be at least IISUR, the total
                surface reaction count, and at least KKTOT for the
                second, the total species count.
    NSTOIC(*,*)-Integer matrix, net change of the phases for the surface
                reactions;
                the first dimension must be at least IISUR, the total
                surface reaction count, and at least NPHASE for the
                second the total phase count.
