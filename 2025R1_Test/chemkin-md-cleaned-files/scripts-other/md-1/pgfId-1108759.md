    SUBROUTINE SKHORT (T, ISKWRK, RSKWRK, HORT)
    Returns an array of the nondimensional enthalpies. Does not account for dependence on surface coverage (HFCOV). To include that effect, use subroutine SKCHORT.
    
    INPUT
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    ISKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENISK.
    RSKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRSK.
    
    OUTPUT
    HORT(*)   - Real array, nondimensional enthalpies for the species;
                dimension at least KKTOT, the total species count.
