    SUBROUTINE CKNU   (KDIM, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, NUKI)
    Returns the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactions.
    
    INPUT
    KDIM      - Integer scalar, first dimension of the matrix NUKI;
                KDIM must be greater than or equal to KK, the total
                species count.
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.
    
    OUTPUT
    NUKI(*,*) - Integer matrix, stoichiometric coefficients of the
                species in the reactions;  dimension at least KK for
                the first, the total species count, and at least II
                for the second, the total reaction count.
                NUKI(K,I) is the stoichiometric coefficient of
                species K in reaction I.
