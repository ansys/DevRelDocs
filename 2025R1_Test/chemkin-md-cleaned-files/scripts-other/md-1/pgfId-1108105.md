    SUBROUTINE SKCOMP (ISTR, IRAY, NN, IND, NT)
    Search for the occurrence of character string ISTR, in the NN
    character strings of array IRAY;
    IND is the first location in IRAY of ISTR if found, or 0 if not
    found, and NT is the total number of times it occurs.
    
       Consider the following example,
          IRAY = {"BOOK","BLUE","BEAR","BOOK"}
          NN=4.
    
       If ISTR="BLUE" then IND=2 and NT=1;
       if ISTR="RED"  then IND=0 and NT=0; and
       if ISTR="BOOK",then IND=1 and NT=2.
    
    INPUT
    ISTR      - Character string.
    IRAY(*)   - Character string array.
    NN        - Integer scalar, length of IRAY(*).
    
    OUTPUT
    IND       - Integer scalar, location in IRAY of the character string
                ISTR, or 0 if ISTR does not appear in IRAY.
    NT        - Integer scalar, total number of times ISTR occurs
                in IRAY.
