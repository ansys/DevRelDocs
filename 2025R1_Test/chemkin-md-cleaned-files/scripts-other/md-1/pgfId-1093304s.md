    SUBROUTINE CKGBMS (P, T, Y, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, GBMS)
    Returns the mean Gibbs free energy of the mixture in mass units
    given pressure, temperature(s), and mass fractions.
    
    INPUT
    P         - Real scalar, pressure.
                   cgs units, dynes/cm**2
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    Y(*)      - Real array, mass fractions of the mixture;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.
    
    OUTPUT
    GBMS      - Real scalar, mean Gibbs free energy.
                   cgs units, ergs/gm
