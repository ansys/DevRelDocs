## Prerequisite Skills

We presume that a user is familiar with the rudiments of setting environment
and path variables; the basic Ansys Chemkin requirements in that regard are
adequately provided by the README files, with further extensive information
and tutorial sessions in [Chemkin Getting Started
Guide](../chemkin_gs/chemkin_gs.md "Chemkin Getting Started Guide") . It is
further presumed that a user-programmer is familiar with the fundamentals of
using the compiler, linker, and make processes of the platform. The Chemkin
Application Programming Interface documentation is not designed to provide
detailed information on those processes, only on how to use them with Chemkin
programs and libraries.
