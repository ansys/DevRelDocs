    SUBROUTINE MCMDIF (P, T, X, KDIM, IMCWRK, RMCWRK, D)
    Returns the ordinary multicomponent diffusion coefficients,
    given pressure, temperature, and mole fractions.

    INPUT
    P         - Real scalar, pressure.
                   cgs units, dynes/cm**2
    T         - Real scalar, temperature.
                   cgs units, K
    X(*)      - Real array, mole fractions of the mixture;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
    KDIM      - Integer scalar, actual first dimension of D(KDIM,KK);
                KDIM must be at least KK, the total species count.
    IMCWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENIMC.
    RMCWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRMC.

    OUTPUT
    D(*,*)    - Real matrix, ordinary multicomponent diffusion
                coefficients;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count, for
                both the first and second dimensions.
                   cgs units, cm**2/s
