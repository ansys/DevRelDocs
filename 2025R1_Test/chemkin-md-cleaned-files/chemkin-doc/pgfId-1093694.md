# CKINIT

    SUBROUTINE CKINIT (LENICK, LENRCK, LENCCK, LINC, LOUT, ICKWRK,
                       RCKWRK, CCKWRK, IFLAG)**
    Reads the linkfile and creates the internal work arrays ICKWRK,
    RCKWRK and CCKWRK.  CKINIT must be called before any other CHEMKIN
    subroutine can be used, as the work arrays must be available as
    their input.  Applications should call CKDONE when finished to cleanup
    resources allocated by CKINIT.
    
    INPUT
    LENICK - Integer scalar, length of the integer work array, ICKWRK.
    LENRCK - Integer scalar, length of the real work array, RCKWRK.
    LENCCK - Integer scalar, length of the character work array, CCKWRK.
    LINC  -  Integer scalar, linkfile input file unit number.
    LOUT  -  Integer scalar, formatted output file unit number.
    
    OUTPUT
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.
    CCKWRK(*) - Character string workspace array;
                dimension at least LENCCK.
    IFLAG     - Integer scalar to indicate successful reading of
                linkfile; IFLAG>0 is an error type.
