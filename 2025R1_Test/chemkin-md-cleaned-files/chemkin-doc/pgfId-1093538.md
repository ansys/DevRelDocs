# CKIEXC

    SUBROUTINE CKIEXC (ICKWRK, RCKWRK, IEXC, EEXC)
    Returns a set of flags indicating whether the reactions are
    excitation reactions and, if so, the energy loss per event in eV.
    
    INPUT
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.
    
    OUTPUT
    IEXC(*)   - Integer array, excitation-only reaction flag;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
                IEXC(I)= -1  reaction I is not an excitation-only reax
                IEXC(I)=  1  reaction I is an excitation reaction
    EEXC(*)   - Real array, excitation energy loss per event in forward
                direction for reactions;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
