    SUBROUTINE CKHML  (T, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, HML)
    Returns the enthalpies in molar units.
    
    INPUT
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.
    
    OUTPUT
    HML(*)    - Real array, enthalpies for species;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
                   cgs units, ergs/mole
