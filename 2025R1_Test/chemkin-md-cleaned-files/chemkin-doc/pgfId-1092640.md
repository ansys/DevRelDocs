# CKCTYP

    SUBROUTINE CKCTYP (P, T, Y, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, CDOT, TAU)
    Returns the molar creation rates and characteristic destruction
    times of the species given pressure, temperature(s) and mass
    fractions.
    
    INPUT
    P         - Real scalar, pressure.
                   cgs units, dynes/cm**2
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    Y(*)      - Real array, mass fractions of the mixture;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.
    
    OUTPUT
    CDOT(*)   - Real array, chemical creation rates of the species;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
                   cgs units, mole/(cm**3*sec)
    TAU(*)    - Real array, characteristic destruction times of the
                species;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
                   cgs units, sec
