# Chapter 4: Quick Reference Guide to the Gas-phase Kinetics Subroutine Library

This chapter is arranged by topical area to provide a quick reference to each
of the _Gas-phase Kinetics_ Library Subroutines. In addition to the subroutine
call list itself, the purpose of the subroutine is briefly described. Where
appropriate, the description refers to an equation number in [Chemkin Theory Manual](https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/public/account/secured?returnurl=/Views/Secured/corp/v242/en/chemkin_th/chemkin_th.html) . Detailed descriptions of the
subroutines are included alphabetically in [Alphabetical Listing of the Gas- phase Kinetics Subroutine Library](i13005api_list_gpk.md "Chapter 7: Alphabetical Listing of the Gas-phase Kinetics Subroutine Library") .
