# User-programmed Subroutines in Reactor Models

User-programmed subroutines (or functions) are used to provide flexibility in
specifying problem constraints that may involve an arbitrary function of time,
distance, or other reactor variable. Before employing user-subroutine options,
users should consider the various piece-wise linear profile options that are
readily available through the user interface and require no programming and
described in the [Chemkin Input Manual](../chemkin_in/chemkin_in.md "Chemkin
Input Manual") Input Manual. These profile options provide similar flexibility
to the user routines, but do not require any programming, recompiling and/or
linking of code.

For each user routine, there is an associated Input option in the associated
Reactor Model input panel, to activate the user routine from the user
interface. To view user routine options in the Ansys Chemkin interface, you
must first go to the Preferences panel (Edit > Preferences) and check the box
that says Display User Routine Options. Once this box is checked, when you
open a new input panel, any user-routine options will be displayed among the
other input options. When manually assembling Reactor Model Input files, this
corresponds to "keyword" that must be included in the input file, which are
described in the [Chemkin Input Manual](../chemkin_in/chemkin_in.md "Chemkin
Input Manual") Input Manual.

[Table 2.1: Keyword and FORTRAN Code Relationships](pgfId-1074407.md#i77953
"Table 2.1: Keyword and FORTRAN Code Relationships") lists the corresponding
keywords described in the [Chemkin Input Manual](../chemkin_in/chemkin_in.md
"Chemkin Input Manual") Input Manual with the name of the subroutine or
function that is turned on by this keyword, and the user routine file in which
a template of the function is found. Also listed is the corresponding
application program shared object (UNIX) or dynamically linked library (PC)
that is used when running the Reactor Model program.

* * *

Note:  If a user replaces or modifies a shared-object's function, that change
will apply to all Reactor Models that employ that shared object, when the user
routine option is enabled. The table of reactor models (Reactor Class Name
column) associated with a particular shared object library (License column)
can be found in the ReactorModels.csv  file located in the data directory of
an Ansys Chemkin install.
