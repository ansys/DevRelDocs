# Discussion of Sample Problem

The sample problem handles each of the 13 possible types of values listed
above. The problem requires not only the chem.inp file (this file has been
changed from earlier examples, to facilitate mixture processes), but also pre-
processing of the _Transport_ Properties, which requires the solution of the
Premixed Flame problem that makes up part of this sample. The _Transport_ pre-
processing can be specified by the `-f ` flag on the mechanism pre-processor
command line, or in the Ansys Chemkin user interface with the checkbox for
fitting _Transport_ data. Mixture processes additionally require an
application solution, such as that of the Premixed Flame problem included in
this sample.

**Note:**   When using this example, you must (i) ensure FLEXLM_ARCH is set
(see [Recompiling and Linking a User Subroutine](i71111.md "2.1.3.
Recompiling and Linking a User Subroutine") ) and (ii) edit the .inc makefile
so that the CKROOT variable is set to the location of your Ansys Chemkin
installation (see [Compile and Link](pgfId-1085750.md#i60052 "3.1.1.6.
Compile and Link") ).
