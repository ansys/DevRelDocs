    SUBROUTINE CKEQYR (RHO, T, Y, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, EQK)
    Returns the equilibrium constants of the reactions given mass
    density, temperature(s) and mass fractions.
    
    INPUT
    RHO       - Real scalar, mass density.
                   cgs units; gm/cm**3
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    Y(*)      - Real array, mass fractions of the mixture;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.
    
    OUTPUT
    EQK(*)   - Real array, equilibrium constants in concentration units
                for reactions;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
                   cgs units; (mole/cm**3)**some power, depending on
                               the reaction
