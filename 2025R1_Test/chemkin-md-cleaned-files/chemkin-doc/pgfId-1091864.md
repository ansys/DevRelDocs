# CKABML

```
SUBROUTINE CKABML (P, T, X, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, ABML)
Returns the Helmholtz free energy of the mixture in molar units
given pressure, temperature(s), and mole fractions.

INPUT
P         - Real scalar, pressure.
                cgs units, dynes/cm**2
T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
            the application program to be the total number of
            species temperatures, nominally 1.
                cgs units, K
X(*)      - Real array, mole fractions of the mixture;
            dimension at least KK, the total species count.
ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

OUTPUT
ABML      - Real scalar, mean Helmholtz free energy.
                cgs units, ergs/mole
