    SUBROUTINE SKHML  (T, ISKWRK, RSKWRK, HML)
    Returns an array of the enthalpies in molar units. Does not account for dependence on surface coverage (HFCOV). To include that effect, use subroutine SKCHML.
    
    INPUT
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    ISKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENISK.
    RSKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRSK.
    
    OUTPUT
    HML(*)    - Real array, enthalpies for the species;
                dimension at least KKTOT, the total species count.
                   cgs units, ergs/mole
