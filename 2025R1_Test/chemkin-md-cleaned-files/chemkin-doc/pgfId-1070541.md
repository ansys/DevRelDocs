SUBROUTINE MCCVEX (K, RMCWRK, COFVIS)
Gets or puts values of the fitting coefficients for the
polynomial fits to species viscosity.

INPUT
K         - Integer scalar, species index.
            K > 0 gets coefficients from RMCWRK
            K < 0 puts coefficients into RMCWRK
RMCWRK(*) - Real workspace array; dimension at least LENRMC.

If K < 1:
COFVIS    - Real vector of polynomial coefficients for
            the species' viscosity; dimension at least NO, usually 4

OUTPUT
If K > 1:
COFVIS    - Real vector of polynomial coefficients; dimension
            at least NO, usually 4
