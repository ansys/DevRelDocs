# Overview of Utilities Packages

_CHEMKIN_ is highly structured and modular, consisting of three basic
utilities packages: _Gas Kinetics, Surface Kinetics, and Transport_. _Gas
Kinetics_ forms the core set of utilities, upon which the other two depend.
Use of these utilities requires the manipulation of a number of programs,
subroutines, and data files. This section describes the structure of the _Gas-
phase Kinetics_ package and the basic requirements for using it from within
your own application programs. [Structure and Use of the Surface Kinetics Utilities](pgfId-1017373.md "1.5. Structure and Use of the Surface Kinetics Utilities") provides similar information for the _Surface Kinetics_ utilities,
while [Structure and Use of the Transport Utilities](pgfId-1021250.md "1.6. Structure and Use of the Transport Utilities") provides an overview of the
_Transport_ utilities.
