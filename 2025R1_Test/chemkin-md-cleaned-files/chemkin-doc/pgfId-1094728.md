    SUBROUTINE CKQYR  (RHO, T, Y, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, Q)
    Returns the rates of progress for reactions given mass density,
    temperature(s) and mass fractions.

    INPUT
    RHO       - Real scalar, mass density.
                   cgs units, gm/cm**3
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    Y(*)      - Real array, mass fractions of the mixture;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    OUTPUT
    Q(*)      - Real array, rates of progress for reactions;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
                   cgs units, moles/(cm**3*sec)
