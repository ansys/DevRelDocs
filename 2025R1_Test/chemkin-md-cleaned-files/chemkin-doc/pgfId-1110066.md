    SUBROUTINE SKSDEN (ISKWRK, RSKWRK, SDEN0)
    Returns a real array of standard-state phase densities as given
    on input to the interpreter.
    
    INPUT
    RSKWRK(*) - Real workspace array; dimension at least LENRSK.
    
    OUTPUT
    SDEN0(*)  - Real array; standard-state densities for the
                site types, AS READ BY THE INTERPRETER;
                dimension at least NPHASE, the total phase count,
                but the subroutine only uses site phase entries,
                NFSURF <= N <= NLSURF.
                   cgs units, moles/cm**2.
