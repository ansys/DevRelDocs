    SUBROUTINE SKFLGS (IR, ISKWRK, NRPP, IREV, ISTFL, ICOV, IMOTZ,
                       IEDP, IBHM, IORD, IYLD)
    Returns several integer flags describing surface reaction IR.
    
    
    INPUT
    IR        - Integer scalar, surface reaction index.
    ISKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENISK.
    
    OUTPUT
    NRPP      - Integer scalar, number of species (reactants+products)
                for surface reaction IR, combined with reversibility
                flag.
                NRPP > 0, NRPP species, reversible surface reaction,
                    < 0, ABS(NRPP) species, irreversible reaction.
    IREV      - Integer scalar, flag for explicit reverse Arrhenius
                parameters.
                =1, reaction has explicit reverse Arrhenius parameters
                =0, no (may or may not be reversible, see NRPP).
    ISTFL     - Integer scalar, flag for sticking coefficients;
                =1, reaction does not use sticking coefficients
                =0, no
    IMOTZ     - Integer scalar, flag for Motz-Wise correction of
                sticking coefficients;
                =1, sticking reaction with Motz-Wise correction
                =0, no (may or may not be sticking reaction, see ISTFL)
    ICOV      - Integer scalar, flag to indidicate that reaction has
                coverage dependence;
                =1, reaction has coverage dependence
                =0, no.
    IEDP      - Integer scalar, flag for energy-dependence;
                =1, reaction is energy-dependent,
                =0, no.
    IBHM      - Integer scalar, flag for Bohm correction;
                =1, Bohm reaction,
                =0, no
    IORD      - Integer scalar, flag for species order change;
                =1, reaction has species order change,
                =0, no
    IYLD      - Integer scalar, flag for yield-modification;
                =1, yield-modification in reaction;
                =0, no
