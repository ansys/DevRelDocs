    SUBROUTINE CKDOT (T, RKF, RKR, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, CDOT, DDOT)
    Returns the molar creation and destruction rates of the species
    given reactions' rates of progress.
    
    INPUT
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature (K).
    RKF(*)    - Real array, reactions' forward rates of progress;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
    RKR(*)    - Real array, reactions' reverse rates of progress;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.
    
    OUTPUT
    CDOT(*)   - Real array, chemical creation rates of the species;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
                   cgs units, mole/(cm**3*sec)
    DDOT(*)   - Real array, chemical destruction rates of the species;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
                   cgs units, moles/(cm**3*sec)
