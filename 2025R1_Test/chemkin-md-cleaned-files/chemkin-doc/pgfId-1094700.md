    SUBROUTINE CKQYP  (P, T, Y, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, Q)
    Returns the rates of progress for reactions given pressure,
    temperature(s) and mass fractions.
    
    INPUT
    P         - Real scalar, pressure.
                   cgs units, dynes/cm**2
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    Y(*)      - Real array, Mass fractions of the mixture;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.
    
    OUTPUT
    Q(*)      - Real array, rates of progress for reactions;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
                   cgs units, moles/(cm**3*sec)
