    SUBROUTINE CKNUF   (KDIM, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, NUFKI)
    Returns the forward stoichiometric coefficients for reactions;
    by definition, reactants' coefficients are negative.
    Contrast this subroutine with subroutine CKNU, which returns the
    net stoichiometric coefficients for a reaction.

    INPUT
    KDIM      - Integer scalar, first dimension of the matrix NUKI;
                KDIM must be greater than or equal to KK, the total
                species count.
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    OUTPUT
    NUFKI(*,*)- Integer matrix, stoichiometric coefficients of the
                species in the forward direction of the reactions
                (reactants only); dimension at least KK in the first,
                the total species count, and at least II for the
                second, the total reaction count.
                NUKI(K,I) is the stoichiometric coefficient of
                species K in forward direction of reaction I.
