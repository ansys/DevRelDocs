    SUBROUTINE CKNCF  (MDIM, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, NCF)
    Returns the elemental composition of the species
    
    INPUT
    MDIM      - Integer scalar, first dimension of the matrix NCF;
                MDIM must be equal to or greater than MM, the total
                element count.
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.
    
    OUTPUT
    NCF(*,*)  - Real matrix, the elemental composition of the species;
                dimension at least MM for the first, the total element
                count, and at least KK for the second, the total species
                count.
                NCF(M,K) is the quantity of the element M in species K.
