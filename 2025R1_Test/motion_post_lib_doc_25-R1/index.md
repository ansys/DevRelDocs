## Operation API

Operation script is a useful functionality that allows you to execute functions provided by Postprocess by using Python Script, allowing you to automate repetitive and time-consuming operations using Python Script.
For example, you can use operation script to save time by automating everything from creating screens, adding results, Postprocessor results, and importing and using other library modules. (Some features may not be available.)
Accessible functionalities by Python operation script:
* [Animation](example_animation_for_operation_api.md)
* [Chart](example_chart_for_operation_api.md)
* [Export](example_export_for_operation_api.md)
* [Analysis](example_analysis_for_operation_api.md)
* [View](example_view_for_operation_api.md)

## Result File Reader

The Postprocessor API is a functionality that allows you to access Ansys Motion analysis results independently of the Postprocessor and extract the desired results. It can be used for process automation, integration with other processes, and integration with design optimization tools.
 * Accessible functionalities by Python Script or C# Library.
