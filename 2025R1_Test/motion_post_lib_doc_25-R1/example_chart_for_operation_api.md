# Chart
The following sample code illustrates how to create a simple example.
* Refer to  operationapi.py in "Ansys installed path/Motion/Document/Postprocessor API for Python.zip"
* The example was created using "Ansys installed path/Motion/Document/Pre and Post Processor.zip"

## Create a chart view
This example demonstrates how to create a chart view.
Chart view is useful for analyzing simulation results by using a graph which is composed of data points.
```
# Example_OperationAPI_CreateChart.py
# Refer to the OperationAPI.py file
import sys
references_path = __file__.rsplit('\\', 1)[0]
sys.path.append(references_path)
from OperationAPI import *

# Start the headless application interface
applicationHandler = ApplicationHandler()

# Import result file
# Get Install Path
# The 'XX' in AWP_ROOTXXX represents the year, like 25 for the year 2025, and the leat 'X' indicates the half of the year,
# where '1' represents the first half and '2' represents the second half.
# For example, in 'AWP_ROOT251' and 'AWP_ROOT252', '25' represents the year 2025, and '1' indicates the first half of the year,
# while '2' indicates the second half.
install_path = get_env_variable("AWP_ROOTXXX")

filepath = combine_path(install_path, r'Motion\Document\Pre and Post Processor\Model\Result\Suspension.dfr')

# Set array about result file
filepaths = List[str]()
filepaths.Add(filepath)

# Open about result files
applicationHandler.AddDocument(filepaths)

# Get Page
page = applicationHandler.GetActivePage()

# Create PlotView
chartView = page.CreateChart("Chart")
chartView.Background = Colors.Blue
chartView.Legend.FontColor = Colors.Black
chartView.Legend.ItemsInFilter = "Visible Curves"
```

## Create Curve
This example demonstrates how to create a curve. A graph can be added to the activated chart view. 
For combinations of paths(Characteristic, Component) on the curve, refer to Common Settings in [Getting Started with the Python language](getting_started_operation_api_using_py.md).

```
# Example_OperationAPI_CreateCurve.py
# Set array about combination of characteristic and component
curvePaths = List[str]()
curvePaths.Add(r'Displacement/Magnitude')
curvePaths.Add(r'Displacement/Z')

# Set a Curve Parameter
parameters = PlotParameters()
parameters.Paths = curvePaths
parameters.Target = "Rack"

# Add Curves (FilePath, Curve Parameter)
# FilePath - The path of the result to access.
# parameters - The class used as a parameter of the AddCurve function.
# Return an array of curve instances.
curves = chartView.AddCurves(filepath, parameters)
count = len(curves)
if count > 0 :
    curves[0].SeriesName = r'Rack_DM'
    curves[0].Color = Colors.Blue
    curves[0].LineStyle = LineStyleType.Dot
```
