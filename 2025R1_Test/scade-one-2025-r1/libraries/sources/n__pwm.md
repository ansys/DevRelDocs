# Pwm

The flow of Pulse-Width Modulation is 1 during the first part of the period and 0 during the second one for every number of cycles. The length of the part is defined by the duty cycle, from 0% to 100% of the period.

The figure shows the output flow for a PWM with the following inputs:

-   cycles: 10
-   dutyCycle: 0.7 \(70%\)
-   amplitude: 1
-   offset: 0
