# Introduction and prerequisites

OpenTD is an Application Programming Interface (API) for Thermal Desktop (TD) that allows you to automate many of the tasks currently performed interactively using TD's Graphical User Interface (GUI). OpenTD gives you the tools to programmatically create, query, edit and delete models, interact with end users, run and control solutions, and manipulate results. You can use any .NET language to interact with OpenTD (C#, VB.NET, F#, etc.) or any system that can load .NET assemblies such as MATLAB or Python.

Regardless of how you interact with OpenTD, you will need to have at least an intermediate understanding of .NET object-oriented programming. If you are starting from scratch, we recommend learning C#, since it is the language that we support. There are many excellent books and internet tutorials available for learning C#. For the remainder of this guide, we will assume you have at least an intermediate knowledge of object-oriented programming and C#, and some familiarity with the .NET global assembly cache (GAC).

OpenTD was installed beginning with TD 6.1, which was released in early 2019. (Preliminary versions of OpenTD were called "TD API". )

We will now introduce OpenTD concepts and syntax in a series of example programs. The latter programs build on concepts introduced in the earlier ones, so we recommend you try them in order.

**I would remove this part as developers can copy code snippets on this website and also because the indicated site is not public**
Copying code examples from pdf files is problematic, so we’ve made the examples available at [https://www.crtech.com/forum/topic/opentdv242-getting-started-code-examples](https://www.crtech.com/forum/topic/opentdv242-getting-started-code-examples).
