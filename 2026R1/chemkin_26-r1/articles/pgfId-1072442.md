**Table 5.12: Utility Subroutines**

| Subroutine        | Description      |
| ---------- | ------- |
| `SUBROUTINE SKCOMP (ISTR, IRAY, NN, IND, NT) `                   | Search for the occurrence of character string ISTR, in the NN character strings of array IRAY; IND is the first location in IRAY of ISTR if found, or 0 if not found, and NT is the total number of times it occurs. Consider the following example, |
| `SUBROUTINE SKPCMP (ISTR, IRAY, NN, SETS, NSETS, ISET, IND, NT)` | This subroutine can do everything that the subroutine SKCOMP can do, and additionally, has the capabilities of separating the elements of IRAY into categories and then search IRAY by element and category. |
|`SUBROUTINE SKPNT (LSAVE, LOUT, VERS, PREC, LENI, LENR, LENC, IERR)`| Reads from a file information about a _Surface Kinetics_ Linking File, pointers for the _Surface Kinetics_ Subroutine Library, and returns lengths of work arrays.  
|`SUBROUTINE SKSNUM (LINE, NEXP, LOUT, KNAM, KKTOT, PNAM, NNPHAS, KKPHAS, KNUM, NT, NVAL, RVAL, KERR)`| This subroutine is used to read a format-free input line of combined alphanumeric data. It can be used to parse an input character string, LINE, which may be composed of several blank-delimited substrings. This subroutine assumes that the first substring in LINE is the name of a species in the _Surface Kinetics_ mechanism.
|`SUBROUTINE SKSAVE (LOUT, LSAVE, ISKWRK, RSKWRK, CSKWRK)` | Writes to a binary file information about a _Surface Kinetics_ Linking File, pointers for the _Surface Kinetics_ Subroutine Library, and _Surface Kinetics_ work arrays.
