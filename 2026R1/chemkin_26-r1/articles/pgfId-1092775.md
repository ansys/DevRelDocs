SUBROUTINE CKCVML (T, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, CVML)
Returns the specific heats in constant volume in molar units.

INPUT
T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
            the application program to be the total number of
            species temperatures, nominally 1.
               cgs units, K
ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

OUTPUT
CVML(*)   - Real array, specific heats at constant volume for
            species;
            dimension at least KK, the total species count.
               cgs units, ergs/(mole*K)
