SUBROUTINE CKKFKR (P, T, X, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, FWDK, REVK)
Returns the forward and reverse reaction rates for reactions
given pressure, temperature(s) and mole fractions.  

INPUT
P         - Real scalar, pressure.
               cgs units, dynes/cm**2
T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
            the application program to be the total number of
            species temperatures, nominally 1.
               cgs units, K
X(*)      - Real array, mole fractions of the mixture;
            dimension at least KK, the total species count.
ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

OUTPUT
FWDK(*)   - Real array, forward reaction rates for reactions;
            dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
               cgs units, depends on the reaction
REVK(*)   - Real array, reverse reaction rates for reactions;
            dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
               cgs units, depends on the reaction
