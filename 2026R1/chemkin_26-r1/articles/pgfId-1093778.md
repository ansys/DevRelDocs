SUBROUTINE CKIORD (IDIM, KDIM, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, NIORD, IORD, FORD,
                   RORD)
Returns the count and indices of reactions with modified species
order and the order values for the species.

INPUT
IDIM      - Integer scalar, dimension of arrays IFORD and IRORD;
            IDIM must be at least NIORD, the total number of
            reactions with modified species orders.
KDIM      - Integer scalar, first dimension of the arrays FORD and
            RORD;
            KDIM must be at least NKK, the total species count.
ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

OUTPUT
NIORD      - Integer scalar, total number of reactions with modified
            species orders.
IORD(*)   - Integer array, indices of reactions with modified
            species orders; dimension at least NIORD.
FORD(*,*) - Real matrix, the modified forward species orders for the
            NIORD reactions;
            dimension at least NKK for the first, the total species
            count, and at least NIORD for the second.
            FORD(K,N) is the forward order of species K for the Nth
            change-order reaction.
RORD(*,*) - Real matrix, the modified reverse species orders for the
            NIORD reactions;
            dimension at least NKK for the first, the total species
            count, and at least NRORD for the second.
            RORD(K,N) is the reverse order of species K for the Nth
            change-order reaction.
