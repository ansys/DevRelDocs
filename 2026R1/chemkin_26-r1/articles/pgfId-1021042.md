# Thermal Diffusion

**Table 6.5: Thermal Diffusion Subroutines**

| Subroutine | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `SUBROUTINE MCATDR (T, X, IMCWRK, RMCWRK, TDR)` | This subroutine computes the thermal diffusion ratios for the light species into the mixture. |
| `SUBROUTINE MCMCDT (P, T, X, IMCWRK, RMCWRK, ICKWRK, CKWRK, DT, COND)` | This subroutine computes the thermal diffusion coefficients, and mixture thermal conductivities given the pressure, temperature, and mole fractions. |
