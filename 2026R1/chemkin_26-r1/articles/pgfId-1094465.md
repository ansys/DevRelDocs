SUBROUTINE CKNU   (KDIM, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, NUKI)
Returns the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactions.

INPUT
KDIM      - Integer scalar, first dimension of the matrix NUKI;
            KDIM must be greater than or equal to KK, the total
            species count.
ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

OUTPUT
NUKI(*,*) - Integer matrix, stoichiometric coefficients of the
            species in the reactions;  dimension at least KK for
            the first, the total species count, and at least II
            for the second, the total reaction count.
            NUKI(K,I) is the stoichiometric coefficient of
            species K in reaction I.
