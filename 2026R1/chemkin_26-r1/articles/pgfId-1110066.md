SUBROUTINE SKSDEN (ISKWRK, RSKWRK, SDEN0)
Returns a real array of standard-state phase densities as given
on input to the interpreter.

INPUT
RSKWRK(*) - Real workspace array; dimension at least LENRSK.

OUTPUT
SDEN0(*)  - Real array; standard-state densities for the
            site types, AS READ BY THE INTERPRETER;
            dimension at least NPHASE, the total phase count,
            but the subroutine only uses site phase entries,
            NFSURF <= N <= NLSURF.
               cgs units, moles/cm**2.
