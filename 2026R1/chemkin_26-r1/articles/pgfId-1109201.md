SUBROUTINE SKKFRT (P, T, ISKWRK, RSKWRK, RKFT, RKRT)
Returns the temperature-dependent forward and reverse reaction
rate coefficients for reactions given pressure and temperature.

INPUT
P         - Real scalar, pressure.
               cgs units, dynes/cm**2
T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
            the application program to be the total number of
            species temperatures, nominally 1.
               cgs units, K
ISKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENISK.
RSKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRSK.

OUTPUT
RKFT(*)   - Real array, forward reaction rates for reactions;
            dimension at least IISUR, the total reaction count.
               cgs units, depends on the reaction
RKRT(*)   - Real array, reverse reaction rates for reactions;
            dimension at least IISUR, the total reaction count.
               cgs units, depends on the reaction
