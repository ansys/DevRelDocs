**Table 6.3: Conductivity Subroutines**

| Subroutine           | Description             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| `SUBROUTINE MCSCON (T, RMCWRK, CON)` | This subroutine computes the array pure species conductivities given the temperature.  
`SUBROUTINE MCACON (T, X, RMCWRK, CONMIX)`| This subroutine computes the mixture thermal conductivity given the temperature and the species mole fractions.  
`SUBROUTINE MCMCDT (P, T, X, IMCWRK, RMCWRK, ICKWRK, CKWRK, DT, COND)`| This subroutine computes the thermal diffusion coefficients and mixture thermal conductivities given the pressure, temperature, and mole fractions.  
`SUBROUTINE MCCCEX (K, KDIM, RCKWRK, COFCON)` | Gets or puts values of the fitting coefficients for the polynomial fits to species conductivity.
