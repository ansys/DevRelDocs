SUBROUTINE CKEQXR (RHO, T, X, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, EQK)
Returns the equilibrium constants of the reactions given mass
density, temperature(s) and mole fractions.

INPUT
RHO       - Real scalar, mass density.
               cgs units, gm/cm**3
T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
            the application program to be the total number of
            species temperatures, nominally 1.
               cgs units, K
X(*)      - Real array, mole fractions of the mixture;
            dimension at least KK, the total species count.
                 species.
ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

OUTPUT
EQK(*)   - Real array, equilibrium constants in concentration units
            for reactions;
            dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
               cgs units, (mole/cm**3)**some power, depending on
                           the reaction
