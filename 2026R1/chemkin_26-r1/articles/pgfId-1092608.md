SUBROUTINE CKCTXR (RHO, T, X, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, CDOT, TAU)
Returns the molar creation rates and characteristic destruction
times of the species given mass density, temperature(s) and mole
fractions.

INPUT
RHO       - Real scalar, mass density.
               cgs units, gm/cm**3
T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
            the application program to be the total number of
            species temperatures, nominally 1.
               cgs units, K
X(*)      - Real array, mole fractions of the mixture;
            dimension at least KK, the total species count.
ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

OUTPUT
CDOT(*)   - Real array, chemical creation rates of the species;
            dimension at least KK, the total species count.
               cgs units, mole/(cm**3*sec)
TAU(*)    - Real array, characteristic destruction times of species;
            dimension at least KK, the total species count.
               cgs units, sec
