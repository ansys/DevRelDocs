| Subroutine | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `SUBROUTINE CKATHM (NDIM1, NDIM2, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, MAXTP, NT, TMP, A)` | Returns the coefficients of the fits for thermodynamic properties of species; see [Equation 2-29](https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/public/account/secured?returnurl=/Views/Secured/corp/v242/en/chemkin_th/pgfId-1116264.html#i18868) through [Equation 2-31](https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/public/account/secured?returnurl=/Views/Secured/corp/v242/en/chemkin_th/pgfId-1116264.html#i59672) . |
| `SUBROUTINE CKCPOR (T, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, CPOR)` | Returns the nondimensional specific heats at constant pressure; see [Equation 2-29](https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/public/account/secured?returnurl=/Views/Secured/corp/v242/en/chemkin_th/pgfId-1116264.html#i18868) . |
| `SUBROUTINE CKHORT (T, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, HORT)` | Returns the nondimensional enthalpies; see [Equation 2-30](https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/public/account/secured?returnurl=/Views/Secured/corp/v242/en/chemkin_th/pgfId-1116264.html#i57749) . |
| `SUBROUTINE CKMXTP (ICKWRK, MAXTP)` | Returns the maximum number of temperatures used in fitting the thermodynamic properties of the species. |
| `SUBROUTINE CKRHEX (K, RCKWRK, A6)` | Returns an array of the sixth thermodynamic polynomial coefficients for a species, or changes their value, depending on the sign of K. |
| `SUBROUTINE CKSMH (T, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, SMH)*` | Returns the array of entropies minus enthalpies for species. It is normally not called directly by the user. |
| `SUBROUTINE CKSOR (T, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, SOR)` | Returns the nondimensional entropies; see [Equation 2-31](https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/public/account/secured?returnurl=/Views/Secured/corp/v242/en/chemkin_th/pgfId-1116264.html#i59672) . |
