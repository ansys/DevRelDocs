SUBROUTINE CKEQC  (T, C, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, EQK)
Returns the equilibrium constants of the reactions given
temperature(s) and molar concentrations.

INPUT
T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
            the application program to be the total number of
            species temperatures, nominally 1.
               cgs units, K
C(*)      - Real array, concentrations of the species;
            dimension at least KK, the total species count.
               cgs units, mole/cm**3
ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

OUTPUT
EQK(*)   - Real array, equilibrium constants in concentration units
            for reactions;
            dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
               cgs units, (mole/cm**3)**some power, depending on
                          the reaction
