SUBROUTINE SKCHORT (T, ACT, ISKWRK, RSKWRK, HORT)
Returns an array of the nondimensional enthalpies.

INPUT
T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
            the application program to be the total number of
            species temperatures, nominally 1.
               cgs units, K
ACT(*)    - Real array, activities of the species;
            dimension at least KKTOT, the total species count.
            The first KKGAS activities are mole fractions,
            the next KKSURF activities are site fractions
            (species density normalized by the site density;
            surface concentration in moles/cm**2 is
            ACT(K)*SITE_DENSITY / # sites per species), and
            the next KKBULK activities for bulk phase species
            should be from 0 to 1, and should sum to 1 for each
            phase.
ISKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENISK.
RSKWRK(*) - Real workspace array; dimension at least LENRSK.

OUTPUT
HORT(*)   - Real array, nondimensional enthalpies for the species;
            dimension at least KKTOT, the total species count.
