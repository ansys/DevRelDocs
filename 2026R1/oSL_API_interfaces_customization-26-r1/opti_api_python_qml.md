# QML Based User Interfaces
Qt Modeling Language (QML) is a user interface markup language that is declarative, similar to CSS and JSON.

Using QML to create custom user interfaces allows you to:

- Create custom interfaces with the exact same look and feel as the optiSLang application interface
- Embed the custom interface into the optiSLang application interface
- Use inline Java scripting for data mining and interaction
