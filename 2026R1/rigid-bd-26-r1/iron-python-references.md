# IronPython references

Rigid Dynamics uses an object-based approach, so it is useful to have
experience with object oriented programming and the Python language when
writing commands for the solver. Ansys Workbench scripting is based on
IronPython, which is well integrated with the rest of the .NET Framework (on
Windows) and Mono CLR (on Linux). This makes all related libraries easily
available to Python programmers while maintaining compatibility with the
Python language. For more information on IronPython, see
<http://ironpython.net>.

IronPython is compatible with existing Python scripts, but not all C-based
Python library modules are available under IronPython. Refer to the
[IronPython website](http://ironpython.net) for more information. For more
information on Python, including a standard language reference, see
<http://www.python.org/>.
