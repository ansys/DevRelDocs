# Foundation API example notebooks

<a id="foundation-api-example-notebooks"></a>

These example scripts show you how to use the foundation API to search for records, export data, and import data. All
examples use the MI Training database, available from the Ansys Download Center.

#### WARNING
Always consult your ACE representative before using the Foundation API. See [Foundation API](../user_guide/package_overview.md#foundation-api) for more
information.

Download all the notebooks and example files [`here`](/samples/foundation/example_files_foundation.zip), or
