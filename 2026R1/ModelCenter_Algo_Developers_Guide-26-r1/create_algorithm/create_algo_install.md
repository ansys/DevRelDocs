# Install the Algorithm

Once the algorithm has been successfully compiled, the algorithm files must be moved where the Optimization Tool can find them.

The Optimization Tool searches the following three locations for algorithms:

- In a subdirectory of the user's algorithms directory. Typically: "C:\Users\\`[username]`\Documents\Optimization Tool\algorithms".

- In a subdirectory of the local machine's algorithms directory. Typically: "C:\Users\Public\Documents\Optimization Tool\algorithms".

- In a subdirectory of Optimization Tool's algorithms directory. Typically, "C:\Program Files\Phoenix Integration\Optimization Tool\algorithms".

  **NOTE:** This is the location for algorithms that are installed with the Optimization Tool, but users may not have write access to this location because of user security privileges.

Copy the algorithm `.dll` (and any files it requires), icon, and help directory to the new directory.
