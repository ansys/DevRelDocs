# DVS Files

<a id="group__group__dvs__file"></a>

Description of DVS files used to load datasets created by the DVS project.

---

 A DVS file (.dvs extension) is used to load the dvs_cache. It contains a [Cache URIs](#group__group__dvs__uri_1dvs_cache_uri) which specifies the location of the cache and filters on what to load from it. It also can contain [Server Options](#group__group__dvs__server_1dvs_server_options) for the dvs_server such as port ranges to use for incoming connections, see [Server Options](#group__group__dvs__server_1dvs_server_options) for more information.





<br/>
 In a future release we will support specifying multiple DVS caches in this file to allow fusing data from multiple sources into one. ---
