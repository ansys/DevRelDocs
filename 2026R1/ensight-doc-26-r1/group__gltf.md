# GLTFWriter Interface

<a id="group__gltf"></a>

A C++ API to write AVZ and GLTF format geometry files.

---

 The GLTFWriter API allows for an application to be able to export geometric scenes in several formats. These scenes can be static or time varying. The lines, triangles and spheres are captured into "AVZ" or glTF 2.0 format files. The AVZ format is basically an extended form of the glTF 1.0 format that includes support for time varying data, variable transformations and 2D overlay options like annotations and palettes. It also supports "meta" entities like spheres.
