# DVS Cache

<a id="group__group__dvs__cache"></a>

DVS Cache can be used to store postprocessing data.

---







The DVS Cache is an optional mechanism to cache data received over the DVS API. This cache can be of multiple domains/types to allow dynamically changing where/how data is stored based on your current needs. The caller of the DVS API needn't worry about the different formats being used other than during server setup if running the DVS Server locally as [Server Options](#group__group__dvs__server_1dvs_server_options).
