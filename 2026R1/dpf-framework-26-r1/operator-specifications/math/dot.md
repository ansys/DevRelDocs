# math:dot (field)

**Version: 0.0.0**

## Description

DEPRECATED, PLEASE USE GENERALIZED INNER PRODUCT. Computes element - wise dot product between two vector fields. If one field's scoping has an 'overall' location, then this field's values are applied on the other field entirely.When using a constant or 'work_by_index', you can use 'inplace' to reuse one of the fields, but only in the case where both fields are scalar.

## Inputs

| Input | Name | Expected type(s) | Description |
|-------|-------|------------------|-------------|
| <strong>Pin 0</strong> <br><span style="background-color:#d93025; color:white; padding:2px 6px; border-radius:3px; font-size:0.75em;">Required</span>|  fieldA |[`field`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#field), [`fields_container`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#fields-container) | field or fields container with only one field is expected |
| <strong>Pin 1</strong> <br><span style="background-color:#d93025; color:white; padding:2px 6px; border-radius:3px; font-size:0.75em;">Required</span>|  fieldB |[`field`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#field), [`fields_container`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#fields-container) | field or fields container with only one field is expected |

## Outputs

| Output |  Name | Expected type(s) | Description |
|-------|------|------------------|-------------|
|  **Pin 0**| field |[`field`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#field) |  |

## Configurations

| Name| Expected type(s) | Default value | Description |
|-----|------|----------|-------------|
| **binary_operation** |binary_operation_enum, [`int32`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#standard-types) | 1 | This option allows to choose how two inputs will be treated together. eOnlyIntersection (0) means that the output will only contain the entities shared by all the inputs. eUnion (1) means that the output will contain all the entities contained in at least one of the inputs. |
| **inplace** |[`bool`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#standard-types) | false | The output is written over the input to save memory if this config is set to true. |
| **mutex** |[`bool`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#standard-types) | false | If this option is set to true, the shared memory is prevented from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads. |
| **num_threads** |[`int32`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#standard-types) | 0 | Number of threads to use to run in parallel |
| **permissive** |[`bool`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#standard-types) | false | If this option is set to true, warning checks (like unit or data sizes) won't be done. |
| **run_in_parallel** |[`bool`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#standard-types) | true | Loops are allowed to run in parallel if the value of this config is set to true. |
| **use_cache** |[`bool`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#standard-types) | true | Some intermediate data is put in cache if this config is set to true. This option can reduce computation time after the first run. |
| **work_by_index** |[`bool`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#standard-types) | false | If this option is set to true, loops and comparisons by entity will be done by index instead of ids. |
