#### *property* CollapseParams.keep_edge_connectivity *: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/functions.html#bool)*

Option to keep edge connectivity. The default value is false. When keep edge connectivity is true, edges that were connected to collapsed triangles will be connected to different triangles. Otherwise, edges will be disconnected from faces.

**This is a beta parameter**. **The behavior and name may change in the future**.
