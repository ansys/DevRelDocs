# Version 2024 R2

The **2024 R2** version of the **Discovery APIs** contains the following changes and additions:

## Custom tree

-   **Performance Enhancements**: Displaying objects in the custom tree now has performance comparable to the design tree, even for a large number of objects. The creation and update times are significantly improved.
-   **Selection Synchronization**: The selection of objects in the custom tree is fully synchronized with their rendering. Actions such as hovering, selecting, and double-clicking in the tree are reflected in the rendering, and vice versa.
-   **Drag and Drop**: An additional callback for drag-and-drop completion is provided, allowing the add-in to respond to the completion of the drop action.
-   **Context Menu**: A right-click \(RMB\) entry for deleting custom objects is automatically created if the add-in permits object deletion.

## HUD

-   **Tool Guide Arrangement**: The vertical and horizontal tool guide arrangement is respected according to the add-in definition in the XML file.
-   **Automatic Validation**: Automatic validation for minimum and maximum values is provided for doubles and quantities used in text boxes, based on the add-in definition in the XML file.
-   **Read-Only Option**: A read-only option is available to disable editing of controls while keeping the controls enabled.

## Variation table

-   **Enhanced APIs**: An additional set of APIs is provided for object-oriented access to the rows and columns of the variation table.
-   **Operation Feedback**: A return type is now provided to indicate the success of the solve operations within the variation table.
