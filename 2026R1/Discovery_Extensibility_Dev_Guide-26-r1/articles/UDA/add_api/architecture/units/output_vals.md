# Outputting values

`Window.Units.Length.Format` produces a length string that can be presented to the user, which includes the units symbol. As well as performing units conversion, this method also formats the output according to whether the user is working in decimals or fractions.

`Window.Units.Angle.Format` provides the same functionality for angles.
