# Index to the Sherlock APIs

In the table below, API services are listed alphabetically. Clicking on any of
the links will take you the pertinent section where the API services are
presented in detail. Also, links at the bottom of the table take you to tables
which define [Scalar Value Types](sherlock-reference.md#scalar-value-types "gRPC Scalar Value Types").

**Table  1.1. Index to the Sherlock APIs**

| **Sherlock APIService**     | **Description**  |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| [Analysis Service](sherlock-reference.md#sherlockanalysisserviceproto) | The APIs in this section allow you to run one or more analyses in sequential order. Results are saved to the project's Saved Results folder on Sherlock Project Tree. `SherlockAnalysisService.proto` |
| [Common Service](sherlock-reference.md#sherlockcommonserviceproto)      | This section contains health checks and exit APIs shared by all services. `SherlockCommonService.proto`  |
[Layer Services](sherlock-reference.md#sherlocklayerserviceproto) | The APIs in this section allow you to perform different layer view operations to a board. `SherlockLayerServices.proto`
[Life Cycle Service](sherlock-reference.md#sherlocklifecycleserviceproto) |  The APIs in this section return the list of Life Cycle events for a given project as well as allow you to define different Life Cycle events and profiles. `SherlockLifeCycleService.proto`
[Model Service](sherlock-reference.md#sherlockmodelserviceproto)|  The APIs in this section allows you to export the 3D model, material definitions, and material assignments from Sherlock so they can be shared with other applications such as Ansys Workbench. `SherlockModelService.proto`
[Parts Service](sherlock-reference.md#sherlockpartsserviceproto) |  In this section you will find APIs that allow you to see the user-configured part libraries, to see a list of parts with properties different than those in the Sherlock Part Library, and to update the Parts List for a given project. `SherlockPartsService.proto`
[Project Service](sherlock-reference.md#sherlockprojectserviceproto)|  The APIs in this section perform project level functions such as generating reports and importing ECAD files. `SherlockProjectService.proto`
[Service](sherlock-reference.md#sherlockserviceproto)|  The APIs in this service should only be used for Sherlock integration with Workbench. `SherlockService.proto`
[Stackup Service](sherlock-reference.md#sherlockstackupserviceproto) |  The APIs in this section allow you to perform updates on laminate layers. `SherlockStackupService.proto`
[Scalar Value Types](sherlock-reference.md#scalar-value-types)| <!--Add a description here--> |
