# PyAnsys use case

That’s a great initiative — adding **use cases** to your developer portal will make it far more engaging and valuable for both technical and executive audiences.

Here’s a clear, flexible **structure** you can use that works well for **developer + executive readers**:

## 🧩 **Recommended Structure for Developer Portal Use Cases**

* Short, action-oriented, and specific.
  → *Example:* “Automating Report Generation Using the ModelCenter API”

---

### 2. **Summary (Executive View)**

* 2–3 sentences summarizing **what the use case achieves** and **why it matters**.
* Focus on **business impact**: time saved, cost reduction, or improved efficiency.
  → *Example:* “This use case demonstrates how integrating the ModelCenter API automates report creation, reducing manual effort by 60%.”

---

### 3. **Problem / Challenge**

* Describe the issue or inefficiency faced before the solution.
* Make it relatable to the reader’s context (operational, business, or technical).
  → *Example:* “Teams were generating reports manually, leading to delays and inconsistent outputs.”

---

### 4. **Solution Overview**

* Summarize how your product (API, SDK, service, etc.) solves the problem.
* Include a high-level architecture diagram or workflow if relevant.
  → *Example:* “Using the ModelCenter API, reports are now generated automatically based on CSV inputs and scheduled tasks.”

---

### 5. **Implementation Details (Developer View)**

Break this down into short, clear sections:

* **Architecture / Flow Diagram** – how components interact.
* **Technologies / APIs Used** – name specific endpoints, SDKs, or libraries.
* **Steps to Reproduce / Implement** – short, numbered steps with code snippets.
* **Configuration / Deployment Notes** – optional but appreciated by devs.

> 💡 Keep this practical and focused — show what to do, not just what happens.

---

### 6. **Results / Benefits**

* Quantify improvements where possible.
* Include both **technical** and **business** metrics.
  → *Example:*

  * “Report generation time reduced from 45 minutes to under 5.”
  * “Developers can now trigger and schedule reports with minimal setup.”

---

### 7. **Key Takeaways / Lessons Learned**

* 2–3 bullet points summarizing what users should remember.
  → *Example:*

  * “Leverage the API’s automation features for consistent reporting.”
  * “Template reuse ensures scalable documentation generation.”

---

### 8. **Resources / References**

* Link to:

  * API documentation
  * GitHub repo or code sample
  * Related tutorials
  * Product page or contact info

---

### 9. **Optional: Executive Snapshot**

If your portal serves mixed audiences, you can provide a **summary box** at the top (or side) that highlights:

* **Business value**
* **Technical complexity** (Low/Medium/High)
* **Estimated implementation time**
* **Main API used**

Would you like me to create a **sample filled-out use case** (e.g., for the “report automation with API” you mentioned earlier) using this structure? That way you can see how it reads in practice for both developers and executives.
