# What is the Solution Applications Framework?

The **Ansys Solution Applications Framework (SAF)** is a low-code inner-source, Python-based framework designed for the development and deployment of custom Ansys-driven solution applications.

SAF is created and maintained by Ansys development teams with significant input from members of the Ansys Customer Excellence (ACE) organization.

SAF enables you to create and modify simulation applications of varying levels of complexity, from extended multi-solver workflow applications to more straightforward applications consisting of a single form.

For more information, review the resources available on the [SAF hub](../saf_hub/index.md#saf-hub-index).
