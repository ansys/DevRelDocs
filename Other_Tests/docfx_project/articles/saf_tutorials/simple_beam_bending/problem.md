# Problem

A solution application is designed to answer to a given engineering problem. In this tutorial, we want to solve a classical problem in mechanical engineering:
the bending of a structure which can be approximated by a beam:

> ##### Objective
> 
> Given a set of geometrical, material, and loading parameters, the goal of the application is to predict the deformed state of the beam subjected to a concentrated load P.

The parametrization of the problem is provided in the figure below:

Geometrical parameters:
: * l: beam length.
  * a: distance of the load P with respect to the left support.
  * b: distance of the load P with respect to the right support.
  * d: diameter of the beam section.

Material parameters:
: * E: Youngâ€™s modulus of elasticity.

Loading:
: * P: concentrated force.

Unknowns:
: * x: coordinate of the center of geometry of the beam center line along x axis in the deformed state.
  * y: coordinate of the center of geometry of the beam center line along y axis in the deformed state.
