### üñ•Ô∏è VS Code

Action

Install VS Code on your computer.
: For the best development experience, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is strongly recommended. In addition to the integrated environment this IDE provides, debugging of solution applications is eased using a specific configuration. Such debugging capabilities are not supported by other tools such as PyCharm.
  <br/>
  Install from the [VS Code official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

Action

Install VS Code extensions.
: VS Code provides extensions to ease the working experience with any kind of programming language. When it comes to solution applications, the following extensions are recommended:
  <br/>
  #### VS Code extensions

: The `toml` and `packaging` Python packages are required for the solution setup.

Action

Install `toml` and `packaging` on your system Python interpreter.

> ```bash
> pip install toml packaging
> ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è ansys-templates
