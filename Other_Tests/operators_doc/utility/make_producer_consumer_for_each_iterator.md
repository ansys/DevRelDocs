# utility:make producer consumer for each iterator

## Description

Generates an iterator that can be consumed by the for_each operator.The chain of Operators are split into a first part : the producers and a second part : the consumers.Asynchronous buffers are indeed to connect the producers and the consumers.

## Inputs


- **Pin -1** try_generate_iterable (type: ['bool']) (optional: True): if true, already iterable values connected in pin 3 like vectors, Scoping, TimefreqSupport, Containers and DataSources are split to iterate on it (default is true)

- **Pin 0** iterable (type: []) (optional: True): Iterable object, generated by make_for_each_range oeprator, that can be combined with the one currently generated.

- **Pin 1** operator_to_iterate (type: ['operator']) (optional: False): Operator that must be reconnected with the range values.

- **Pin 2** pin_index (type: ['int32']) (optional: False): 

- **Pin 3** valueA (type: []) (optional: False): 

- **Pin 4** valueB (type: []) (optional: False): 

- **Pin 5** valueC (type: []) (optional: False): 

- **Pin 1000** producer_op1 (type: ['operator']) (optional: False): 

- **Pin 1001** output_pin_of_producer_op1 (type: ['int32']) (optional: False): 

- **Pin 1002** input_pin_of_consumer_op1 (type: ['int32']) (optional: False): 

- **Pin 1003** consumer_op1 (type: ['operator']) (optional: False): 


## Outputs


- **Pin 0** iterator (type: []): to connect to producer_consumer_for_each


## Configurations


- **mutex** (type: ['bool']) (default: false): If this option is set to true, the shared memory is prevented from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads.
