    SUBROUTINE CKIORD (IDIM, KDIM, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, NIORD, IORD, FORD,
                       RORD)
    Returns the count and indices of reactions with modified species
    order and the order values for the species.

    INPUT
    IDIM      - Integer scalar, dimension of arrays IFORD and IRORD;
                IDIM must be at least NIORD, the total number of
                reactions with modified species orders.
    KDIM      - Integer scalar, first dimension of the arrays FORD and
                RORD;
                KDIM must be at least NKK, the total species count.
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    OUTPUT
    NIORD      - Integer scalar, total number of reactions with modified
                species orders.
    IORD(*)   - Integer array, indices of reactions with modified
                species orders; dimension at least NIORD.
    FORD(*,*) - Real matrix, the modified forward species orders for the
                NIORD reactions;
                dimension at least NKK for the first, the total species
                count, and at least NIORD for the second.
                FORD(K,N) is the forward order of species K for the Nth
                change-order reaction.
    RORD(*,*) - Real matrix, the modified reverse species orders for the
                NIORD reactions;
                dimension at least NKK for the first, the total species
                count, and at least NRORD for the second.
                RORD(K,N) is the reverse order of species K for the Nth
                change-order reaction.
