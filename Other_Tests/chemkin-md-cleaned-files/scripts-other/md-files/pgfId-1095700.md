    SUBROUTINE CKWYPK  (P, T, Y, RKFT, RKRT, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, WDOT)
    Returns the molar production rates of the species given pressure,
    temperature(s) and mass fractions.

    INPUT
    P         - Real scalar, pressure.
                   cgs units, dynes/cm**2
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    Y(*)      - Real array, mass fractions of the mixture;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
    RKFT(*)   - Real array, forward reaction rates for reactions;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
                   cgs units, depends on the reaction
    RKRT(*)   - Real array, reverse reaction rates for reactions;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
                   cgs units, depends on the reaction
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    OUTPUT
    WDOT(*)   - Real array, chemical production rates of the species;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
                   cgs units, moles/(cm**3*sec)
