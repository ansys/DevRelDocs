    SUBROUTINE SKCPML (T, ISKWRK, RSKWRK, CPML)
    Returns an array of the specific heats at constant pressure
    in molar units.

    INPUT
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    ISKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENISK.
    RSKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRSK.

    OUTPUT
    CPML(*)   - Real array, specific heats at constant pressure for the
                species;
                dimension at least KKTOT, the total species count.
                   cgs units, ergs/(mole*K)
