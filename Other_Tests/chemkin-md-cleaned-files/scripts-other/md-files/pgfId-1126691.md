# VODE Summary

The VODE solver[Equation 3-1](pgfId-1085459.md#pgfId-1082323 "(3â€“1)") is
reliable for the solution of a wide range of stiff initial-value problems. The
source code for the solver is provided in the Ansys Chemkin subdirectory
source_public\vode.f (PC), source_public/vode.f (UNIX), which is extensively
commented as to its implementation.

    C Summary of usage.
    C
    C Communication between the user and the DVODE package, for normal
    C situations, is summarized here. This summary describes only a subset
    C of the full set of options available. See the full description for
    C details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
    C and instructions for special situations. See also the example
    C problem (with program and output) following this summary.
    C
    C A. First provide a subroutine of the form..
    C
    C      SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT, RPAR, IPAR)
    C      DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y, YDOT, RPAR
    C      DIMENSION Y(NEQ), YDOT(NEQ)
    C
    C which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with f(i).
    C
    C B. Next determine (or guess) whether or not the problem is stiff.
    C Stiffness occurs when the Jacobian matrix df/dy has an eigenvalue
    C whose real part is negative and large in magnitude, compared to the
    C reciprocal of the t span of interest. If the problem is nonstiff,
    C use a method flag MF = 10. If it is stiff, there are four standard
    C choices for MF (21, 22, 24, 25), and DVODE requires the Jacobian
    C matrix in some form. In these cases (MF .gt. 0), DVODE will use a
    C saved copy of the Jacobian matrix. If this is undesirable because of
    C storage limitations, set MF to the corresponding negative value
    C (-21, -22, -24, -25). (See full description of MF below.)
    C The Jacobian matrix is regarded either as full (MF = 21 or 22),
    C or banded (MF = 24 or 25). In the banded case, DVODE requires two
    C half-bandwidth parameters ML and MU. These are, respectively, the
    C widths of the lower and upper parts of the band, excluding the main
    C diagonal. Thus the band consists of the locations (i,j) with
    C i-ML .le. j .le. i+MU, and the full bandwidth is ML+MU+1.
    C
    C C. If the problem is stiff, you are encouraged to supply the Jacobian
    C directly (MF = 21 or 24), but if this is not feasible, DVODE will
    C compute it internally by difference quotients (MF = 22 or 25).
    C If you are supplying the Jacobian, provide a subroutine of the form..
    C
    C      SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, PD, NROWPD, RPAR, IPAR)
    C      DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y, PD, RPAR
    C      DIMENSION Y(NEQ), PD(NROWPD,NEQ)
    C
    C which supplies df/dy by loading PD as follows..
    C   For a full Jacobian (MF = 21), load PD(i,j) with df(i)/dy(j),
    C the partial derivative of f(i) with respect to y(j). (Ignore the
    C ML and MU arguments in this case.)
    C   For a banded Jacobian (MF = 24), load PD(i-j+MU+1,j) with
    C df(i)/dy(j), i.e. load the diagonal lines of df/dy into the rows of
    C PD from the top down.
    C   In either case, only nonzero elements need be loaded.
    C
    C D. Write a main program which calls subroutine DVODE once for
    C each point at which answers are desired. This should also provide
    C for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
    C by DVODE. On the first call to DVODE, supply arguments as follows..
    C F   = Name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
    C     This name must be declared external in calling program.
    C NEQ  = Number of first order ODE-s.
    C Y   = Array of initial values, of length NEQ.
    C T   = The initial value of the independent variable.
    C TOUT  = First point where output is desired (.ne. T).
    C ITOL  = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
    C RTOL  = Relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
    C ATOL  = Absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
    C     The estimated local error in Y(i) will be controlled so as
    C     to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
    C       EWT(i) = RTOL*abs(Y(i)) + ATOL   if ITOL = 1, or
    C       EWT(i) = RTOL*abs(Y(i)) + ATOL(i) if ITOL = 2.
    C     Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
    C     either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
    C     or the relative error is less than RTOL.
    C     Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
    C     use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
    C     control. Caution.. Actual (global) errors may exceed these
    C     local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
    C ITASK = 1 for normal computation of output values of Y at t = TOUT.
    C ISTATE = Integer flag (input and output). Set ISTATE = 1.
    C IOPT  = 0 to indicate no optional input used.
    C RWORK = Real work array of length at least..
    C       20 + 16*NEQ           for MF = 10,
    C       22 + 9*NEQ + 2*NEQ**2      for MF = 21 or 22,
    C       22 + 11*NEQ + (3*ML + 2*MU)*NEQ for MF = 24 or 25.
    C LRW  = Declared length of RWORK (in user's DIMENSION statement).
    C IWORK = Integer work array of length at least..
    C       30    for MF = 10,
    C       30 + NEQ for MF = 21, 22, 24, or 25.
    C     If MF = 24 or 25, input in IWORK(1),IWORK(2) the lower
    C     and upper half-bandwidths ML,MU.
    C LIW  = Declared length of IWORK (in user's DIMENSION).
    C JAC  = Name of subroutine for Jacobian matrix (MF = 21 or 24).
    C     If used, this name must be declared external in calling
    C     program. If not used, pass a placeholder name.
    C MF   = Method flag. Standard values are..
    C     10 for nonstiff (Adams) method, no Jacobian used.
    C     21 for stiff (BDF) method, user-supplied full Jacobian.
    C     22 for stiff method, internally generated full Jacobian.
    C     24 for stiff method, user-supplied banded Jacobian.
    C     25 for stiff method, internally generated banded Jacobian.
    C RPAR,IPAR = user-defined real and integer arrays passed to F and JAC.
    C Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, RWORK, IWORK,
    C and possibly ATOL, RPAR, and IPAR.
    C
    C E. The output from the first call (or any call) is..
    C   Y = Array of computed values of y(t) vector.
    C   T = Corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
    C ISTATE = 2 if DVODE was successful, negative otherwise.
    C     -1 means excess work done on this call. (Perhaps wrong MF.)
    C     -2 means excess accuracy requested. (Tolerances too small.)
    C     -3 means illegal input detected. (See printed message.)
    C     -4 means repeated error test failures. (Check all input.)
    C     -5 means repeated convergence failures. (Perhaps bad
    C       Jacobian supplied or wrong choice of MF or tolerances.)
    C     -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
    C       component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
    C F. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
    C reset TOUT and call DVODE again. No other parameters need be reset.
