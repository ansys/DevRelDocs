    SUBROUTINE SKKFRT (P, T, ISKWRK, RSKWRK, RKFT, RKRT)
    Returns the temperature-dependent forward and reverse reaction
    rate coefficients for reactions given pressure and temperature.

    INPUT
    P         - Real scalar, pressure.
                   cgs units, dynes/cm**2
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    ISKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENISK.
    RSKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRSK.

    OUTPUT
    RKFT(*)   - Real array, forward reaction rates for reactions;
                dimension at least IISUR, the total reaction count.
                   cgs units, depends on the reaction
    RKRT(*)   - Real array, reverse reaction rates for reactions;
                dimension at least IISUR, the total reaction count.
                   cgs units, depends on the reaction
