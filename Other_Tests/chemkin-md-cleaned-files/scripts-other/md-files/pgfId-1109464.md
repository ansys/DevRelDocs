    SUBROUTINE SKNUF   (IDIM, ISKWRK, KSTOIF)
    Returns the stoichiometric coefficients of the species
    for all reactants in all surface reactions in a mechanism.
    (note - reactants only! - they will all be negative)

    INPUT
    IDIM      - Integer scalar, first dimension of the array NSTOIC;
                must be at least ISUR, the total surface reaction count.
    ISKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENISK.

    OUTPUT
    KSTOIF(*,*)-Integer matrix,  stoichiometric coefficients for the
                reactants in the surface reactions;
                dimension at least IISUR for the first, the total surface
                reaction  ount, and at least KKTOT for the second, the
                total species count.
