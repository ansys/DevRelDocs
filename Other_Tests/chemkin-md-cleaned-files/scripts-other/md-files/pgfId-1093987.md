    SUBROUTINE CKITR (ICKWRK, RCKWRK, ITHB, IREV)
    Returns a set of flags indicating whether the reactions are
    reversible or whether they contain arbitrary third bodies

    INPUT
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.

    OUTPUT
    ITHB(*)   - Integer array, third-body indices for reactions;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
                ITHB(I)= -1  reaction I is not a third-body reactions
                ITHB(I)=  0  reaction I is a third-body reaction with
                             no enhanced third body efficiencies
                ITHB(I)=  N  reaction I is a third-body reaction with
                          N species enhanced third-body efficiencies.

    IREV(*)   - Integer array, reversibility indices and species
                count (reactants plus products) for reactions;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
                IREV(I)=+N, reversible reaction I has N species
                IREV(I)=-N, irreversible reaction I has N species
