    SUBROUTINE CKIMOM (ICKWRK, IMOM)
    Returns a set of flags indicating whether the reactions are
    electron momentum-transfer collision frequencies and, if so,
    the index of the species with which the electron collides.

    INPUT
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.

    OUTPUT
    IMOM(*)   - Integer array, electron momentum-transfer collision
                frequency flags for reactions;
                dimension at least II, the total reaction count.
                IMOM(I)= -1  reaction I is not a mom-transfer coll freq
                IMOM(I)=  K  reaction I is a mom-transfer coll frequency
                          and K is species index of the electron's
                          collision partner
