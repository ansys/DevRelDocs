    SUBROUTINE SKCGML (T, ACT, ISKWRK, RSKWRK, GML)
    Returns an array of the standard state Gibbs free energies
    in molar units.

    INPUT
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
              the application program to be the total number of
              species temperatures, nominally 1.
                 cgs units, K
    ACT(*)    - Real array, activities of the species;
                dimension at least KKTOT, the total species count.
                The first KKGAS activities are mole fractions,
                the next KKSURF activities are site fractions
                (species density normalized by the site density;
                surface concentration in moles/cm**2 is
                ACT(K)*SITE_DENSITY / # sites per species), and
                the next KKBULK activities for bulk phase species
                should be from 0 to 1, and should sum to 1 for each
                phase.
    ISKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENISK.
    RSKWRK(*) - Real workspace array; dimension at least LENRSK.

    OUTPUT
    GML(*)    - Real array, standard state Gibbs free energies
                for the species;
                dimension KKTOT, the total species count.
                   cgs units, ergs/mole
