    SUBROUTINE CKXTCP (P, T, X, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, C)
    Returns the molar concentrations given pressure, temperature(s)
    and mole fractions.
    
    INPUT
    P         - Real scalar, pressure.
                   cgs units, dynes/cm**2
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    X(*)      - Real array, mole fractions of the mixture;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.
    
    OUTPUT
    C(*)      - Real array, concentrations of the species;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
                   cgs units, mole/cm**3
