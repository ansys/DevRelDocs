Subroutine |  Description  
---|---  
`SUBROUTINE CKATHM (NDIM1, NDIM2, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, MAXTP, NT, TMP, A)` |  Returns the coefficients of the fits for thermodynamic properties of species; see [Equation 2-29](../chemkin_th/pgfId-1116264.md#i18868 "Equation 2–29") through [Equation 2-31](../chemkin_th/pgfId-1116264.md#i59672 "Equation 2–31") .  
`SUBROUTINE CKCPOR (T, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, CPOR)` |  Returns the nondimensional specific heats at constant pressure; see [Equation 2-29](../chemkin_th/pgfId-1116264.md#i18868 "Equation 2–29") .  
`SUBROUTINE CKHORT (T, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, HORT)` |  Returns the nondimensional enthalpies; see [Equation 2-30](../chemkin_th/pgfId-1116264.md#i57749 "Equation 2–30") .   
`SUBROUTINE CKMXTP (ICKWRK, MAXTP)` |  Returns the maximum number of temperatures used in fitting the thermodynamic properties of the species.  
`SUBROUTINE CKRHEX (K, RCKWRK, A6)` |  Returns an array of the sixth thermodynamic polynomial coefficients for a species, or changes their value, depending on the sign of K.  
`SUBROUTINE CKSMH (T, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, SMH)*` |  Returns the array of entropies minus enthalpies for species. It is normally not called directly by the user.  
`SUBROUTINE CKSOR (T, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, SOR)` |  Returns the nondimensional entropies; see [Equation 2-31](../chemkin_th/pgfId-1116264.md#i59672 "Equation 2–31") .
