    SUBROUTINE CKWXR  (RHO, T, X, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, WDOT)
    Returns the molar production rates of the species given mass
    density, temperature(s) and mole fractions.
    
    INPUT
    RHO       - Real scalar, mass density.
                   cgs units, gm/cm**3
    T(*)      - Real array, temperature(s); dimension is determined by
                the application program to be the total number of
                species temperatures, nominally 1.
                   cgs units, K
    X(*)      - Real array, mole fractions of the mixture;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
    ICKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENICK.
    RCKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRCK.
    
    OUTPUT
    WDOT(*)   - Real array, chemical production rates of the species;
                dimension at least KK, the total species count.
                   cgs units, moles/(cm**3*sec)
