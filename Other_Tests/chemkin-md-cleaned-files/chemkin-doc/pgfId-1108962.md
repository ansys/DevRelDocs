    SUBROUTINE SKINU   (IR, NDIM, ISKWRK, RSKWRK, NSPEC, KI, NU)
    Returns the number of species in a surface reaction, and the
    species indices and stoichiometric coefficients.

    INPUT
    IR        - Integer scalar, index number of a surface reaction;
                IR must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to
                IISUR, the total surface reaction count.
    NDIM      - Integer scalar, dimension of the arrays KI and NU;
                NDIM must be at least MAXSPR, the total number of
                species allowed in a surface reaction.
    ISKWRK(*) - Integer workspace array; dimension at least LENISK.
    RSKWRK(*) - Real    workspace array; dimension at least LENRSK.

    OUTPUT
    NSPEC     - Integer scalar, the number of species (reactants +
                products) in surface reaction IR.
    KI(*)     - Integer array, species indices for the species in surface
                reaction IR;
                dimension at least MAXSPR, the total number of species
                allowed in a surface reaction.
    NU(*)     - Integer array, stoichiometric coefficients of the
                species in surface reaction IR;
                dimension at least MAXSPR, the total number of species
                allowed in a surface reaction.
                NU is negative if the Nth species is a reactant;
                NU is positive if the Nth species is a product.
