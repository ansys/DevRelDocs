# Chapter 7: Alphabetical Listing of the Gas-phase Kinetics Subroutine Library

Each subroutine in the _Gas-phase Kinetics_ Subroutine Library is described in
this chapter, together with a detailed description of the variables in the
call lists. For all arrays, information is given on the required dimensioning
in the calling program. For all variables having units, the cgs units are
stated.

In most cases the subroutines are backwards compatible with the original
version of _Chemkin_. However, there are some cases where either the
functionality is different or the call list has changed, but we have kept the
same subroutine name.

* * *

**Note:**   All routines for which the call list or functionality may have
changed from the original version of _Chemkin_ are identified by an asterisk.
Subroutines whose call lists have changed since later versions, known as
_Chemkin_ II, are indicated by a double asterisk.
