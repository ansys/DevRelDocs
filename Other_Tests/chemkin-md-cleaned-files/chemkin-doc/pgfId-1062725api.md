# Initialization and Parameters

**Table 6.1: Initialization and Parameter Subroutines**

| Subroutine                                                         | Description |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `SUBROUTINE MCINIT (LINKMC, LOUT, LENIMC, LENRMC, IMCWRK, RMCWRK)` | This        |
subroutine serves to read the Linking File from the fitting code and to create
the internal storage and work arrays, IMCWRK(*) and RMCWRK (*). MCINIT must be
called before any other _Transport_ subroutine is called. It must be called
after the _Gas-phase Kinetics_ package is initialized.  
`SUBROUTINE MCPRAM (IMCWRK, RMCWRK EPS, SIG, DIP, POL, ZROT, NLIN)`| This
subroutine is called to return the arrays of molecular parameters as read from
the Transport database.  
`SUBROUTINE MCPNT (LSAVE, LOUT, NPOINT, V, P, LI, LR, IERR)` | Reads from a binary file information about a _Transport_ linkfile, pointers for the _Transport_ Library, and returns lengths of work arrays.  
`SUBROUTINE MCSAVE (LOUT, LSAVE, IMCWRK, RMCWRK)` | Writes to a binary file information about a _Transport_ linkfile, pointers for the _Transport_ library, and _Transport_ work arrays.  
`SUBROUTINE MCREWR (LINKMC, LOUT, IMCWRK, RMCWRK, IFLAG)` | This subroutine writes a new the _Transport_ linkfile from the data stored in the integer and real work arrays, IMCWRK(*) and RMCWRK(*).  
`SUBROUTINE MCLEN (LINKMC, LOUT, LI, LR, IFLAG)` | Returns the lengths required for work arrays.
