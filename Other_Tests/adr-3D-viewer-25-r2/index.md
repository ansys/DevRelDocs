# Introduction

The Ansys ADR 3D Viewer Web Component is a web component capable of rendering 3D geometry in a web page using different rendering configurations. The component can render in the browser using WebGL or remote over VNC (e.g. accessing EnSight or EnVision remote instances). This component is automatically made available using the \ref websocketserver_cli (the component is served under /ansys###/nexus in that configuration).
