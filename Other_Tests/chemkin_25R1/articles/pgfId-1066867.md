| `SUBROUTINE CKINIT (LENICK, LENRCK, LENCCK, LINC, LOUT, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, CCKWRK, IFLAG)**`         | Reads the linkfile and creates the internal work arrays ICKWRK, RCKWRK and CCKWRK. CKINIT must be called before any other _Gas-phase Kinetics_ subroutine can be used, as the work arrays must be available as their input. |

| `SUBROUTINE CKLEN2 (LINC, LOUT, LI, LR, LC, MM, KK, II, MAXSP, MAXTP, MAXTB, MAXORD, KKI, IFLAG)` | Returns the lengths required for work arrays, as well as mechanism size information for memory allocation.                                                                                                                  |

| `SUBROUTINE CKREWR (LINC, LOUT, ICKWRK, RCKWRK, CCKWRK, IFLAG)`                                   | Rewrites a new linkfile from the data stored in ICKWRK, RCKWRK and CCKWRK.                                                                                                                                                  |

| `SUBROUTINE PKINDX (ICKWRK, KELECT, KKION)`                                                       | Returns plasma indices for the particular reaction mechanism.                                                                                                                                                               |
