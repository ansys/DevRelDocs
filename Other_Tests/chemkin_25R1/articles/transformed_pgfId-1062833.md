Table 6.4: Diffusion Coefficients Subroutines

Subroutine| Description  
---|---  
`SUBROUTINE MCSDIF (P, T, KDIM, RMCWRK, DJK)` | This subroutine computes the binary diffusion coefficients given the pressure and temperature.  
`SUBROUTINE MCADIF (P, T, X, RMCWRK, D)`| This subroutine computes the
mixture-averaged diffusion coefficients given the pressure, temperature, and
species mole fractions.  
`SUBROUTINE MCMDIF (P, T, X, KDIM, IMCWRK, RMCWRK, D)` | This subroutine computes the ordinary multicomponent diffusion coefficients given the pressure, temperature, and mole fractions.   
`SUBROUTINE MCCDEX (K, KDIM, RCKWRK, COFDIF)` | Gets or puts values of the fitting coefficients for the polynomial fits to species binary diffusion coefficients.
