The Base URL is a crucial element for making API calls, enabling you to clearly specify the root URL(s) for API requests. When making API calls, you combine the base URL with the specific endpoint path to form the complete request URL.

It supports multiple environments, including staging and production. Additionally, the base URL synchronizes with the API explorer, allowing you to seamlessly switch between environments like Sandbox and Production while trying out API calls.
