# ansys.meshing.prime.MultiZoneSweepMeshParams.thin_sweep



#### *property* MultiZoneSweepMeshParams.thin_sweep *: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/functions.html#bool)*

Thin sweep option set to True will generate sweep mesh in thin volumes by respecting nDivisions.   Thin sweep option set to False will generate sweep mesh whose number of divisions in the direction of sweep is determined by sweepMeshSize.

**This is a beta parameter**. **The behavior and name may change in the future**.
