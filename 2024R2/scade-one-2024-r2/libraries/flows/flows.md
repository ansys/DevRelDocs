# Flows

The Flows library provides a set of simple operators on flows \(delays, counters, timers, etc\).

|Operator Name|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|[BoundedEventCountDown](flows__boundedeventcountdown.md)|Decreases the count by one at each cycle when the input is down to a limit value.|
|[BoundedEventCountUp](flows__boundedeventcountup.md)|Increases the count by one at each cycle when the input is up to a limit value.|
|[Delay](flows__delay.md)|Delays the input flow by the specified number of cycles.|
|[DetectChange](flows__detectchange.md)|Determines if the current value of the flow does not equal its value at the last cycle.|
|[EventCountDown](flows__eventcountdown.md)|Decreases the count by one at each cycle when the input is true.|
|[EventCountUp](flows__eventcountup.md)|Increases the count by one at each cycle when the input is true.|
|[Max](flows__max.md)|Computes the maximum value observed on the input flow over time.|
|[Min](flows__min.md)|Computes the minimum value observed on the input flow over time.|
|[Times](flows__times.md)|Counts down the repeated occurrence if the condition input is true before rising a flag.|
