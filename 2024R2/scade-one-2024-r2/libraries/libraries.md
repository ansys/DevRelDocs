# Introduction

Scade One provides a set of libraries that can be used for model design for simulation and debug of models.

-   **[Bitfield](../libraries/bitfield/bitfield.md)**  
The BitField library provides a set of operations on arrays of bits or integers seen as array of bits, with conversion from/to array of Boolean values. It also provides operators to make/split bit-fields from/to bytes.
-   **[Check](../libraries/check/check.md)**  
The Check library provides a set of operators to build oracles for test harnesses, which are divided into several categories.
-   **[Digital](../libraries/digital/digital.md)**  
The Digital library provides a set of basic functions aiming to help the construction of more complex digital data treatment algorithms.
-   **[Float](../libraries/float/float.md)**  
The Float library ensures good practices in the use of floating-point numbers.
-   **[Flows](../libraries/flows/flows.md)**  
The Flows library provides a set of simple operators on flows \(delays, counters, timers, etc\).
-   **[Math::Common](../libraries/common/math_common.md)**  
Common mathematical operations.
-   **[Math::Complex](../libraries/complex/math_complex.md)**  
Type and operations on complex numbers.
-   **[Math::Trigo](../libraries/trigo/math_trigo.md)**  
Common trigonometric functions and their inverse.
-   **[Sources](../libraries/sources/sources.md)**  
The Sources library provides a set of flow generators, mostly numeric, for usage in test harnesses.
