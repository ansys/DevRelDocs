For practical examples of how to use these APIs in Mechanical, refer to the [Scripting in Mechanical Guide](https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/public/account/secured?returnurl=/Views/Secured/corp/v242/en/act_script/act_script.html). This guide contains similar information to the [ACT API Reference Guide](https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/public/account/secured?returnurl=/Views/Secured/corp/v242/en/act_ref/act_ref.html) but focuses on practical applications. The *ACT API Reference Guide* provides a comprehensive listing of all supported APIs, while this documentation offers a curated subset specifically for Mechanical.
