# DPF Mechanical 2025 R2 Documentation

Welcome to the DPF Mechanical 2025 R2 documentation for Ansys Mechanical.

## Overview

The Ansys Data Processing Framework (DPF) provides a modern, comprehensive infrastructure for accessing and manipulating simulation data. DPF enables you to process large amounts of simulation data efficiently through a client-server architecture.

This documentation is specifically for **Ansys Mechanical users** who work with DPF through:
- The **Python Result object** in the Mechanical interface
- The **Scripting window** in Ansys Mechanical
- Custom scripts and extensions using IronPython

Both interfaces expose DPF through IronPython using the underlying C# DLLs, allowing you to leverage DPF's capabilities using Python syntax within the Mechanical environment.

## Documentation Sections

### [Getting Started](getting-started/index.md)
Learn how to set up your environment and run your first DPF IronPython script.

### [User Guide](user-guide/index.md)
Comprehensive guides covering core concepts, workflows, and best practices.

### [Examples](examples/index.md)
Practical code examples demonstrating common DPF operations and workflows.

### [API Reference](api/index.md)
Complete API documentation for all DPF IronPython classes, methods, and properties.
