# ansys.meshing.prime.lucid.Mesh.connect_faces

#### Mesh.connect_faces(part_expression='\*', face_labels='\*', target_face_labels='\*', tolerance=0.05)

Connect face zonelets with a label name pattern within a given tolerance.

This method connects face zonelets with a label name pattern to
face zonelets with target face labels within a given tolerance. The connection
happens within the part. Face zonelets of a part are connected with face zonelets
of the same part only.

* **Parameters:**
  **part_expression**
  : Name pattern of the parts to use for connecting the face zonelets. The
    default is `"*"`.

  **face_labels**
  : Name pattern of the face labels used for connecting the face zonelets.
    The default is `"*"`.

  **target_face_labels**
  : Name pattern of the face labels to connect. The default is `"*"`.

  **tolerance: float, optional**
  : Tolerance for the connection. The default is `0.05`.
