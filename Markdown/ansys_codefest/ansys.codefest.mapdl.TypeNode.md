# <kbd>class</kbd> `TypeNode`
Enum for the type a node can be. 

START nodes are those at which you enter a cavern. END nodes are the exit nodes for the caverns. CONSTRUCTED nodes are built by yourself or your machine. ROCK nodes are fixed nodes that are pre-existing in the caverns. 



**Examples:**
 ```python-repl
     >>> new = TypeNode.START
     >>> new
     <TypeNode.START: 1>
```
