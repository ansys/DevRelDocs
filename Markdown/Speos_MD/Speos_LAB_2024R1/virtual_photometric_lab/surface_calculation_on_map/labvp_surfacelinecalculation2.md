# SurfaceLineCalculation2 

## Description 

Returns an array of 5 VARIANT of the values for the given line in the following order: minimum value, maximum value, average, Range X, Range Y.

## Syntax 

*object*.SurfaceLineCalculation\(double dXPos1, double dYPos1, double dXPos2, double dYPos2, double dSampling, double dThresholdLevel\) As Variant

-   *object*: Virtual Photometric Lab object

-   *dXPos1*: horizontal coordinate of the first vertex of the line

-   *dYPos1*: vertical coordinate of the first vertex of the line

-   *dXPos2*: horizontal coordinate of the second vertex of the line

-   *dYPos2*: vertical coordinate of the second vertex of the line

-   *dSampling*: distance between two measurement points on the map \(for example the result returned by XSampleWidth or YSampleHeight\)

-   *dThresholdLevel*: Iso level defined to measure the range X and Y
