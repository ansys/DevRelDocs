# Fluids

The Ansys Common Fluids Format SDK provides APIs, data models, and example programs to access or write data to Ansys Common Fluids Format files. This format is also used by Ansys Fluids products. For more information, see [Ansys Common Fluids Format SDK for developers (Developer Portal documentation)](https://developer.ansys.com/docs/cff).

## Fluent

Ansys Fluent includes both a GUI and a TUI. The TUI uses a dialect of Lisp named [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)). For more information about the Fluent TUI, see [Text user interface](https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/public/account/secured?returnurl=/Views/Secured/corp/v242/en/flu_ug/tgd_tcl_tui.html) in the Fluent product documentation.

Fluent provides an open-source Python interface named PyFluent, which is part of PyAnsys. It also includes two complementary PyAnsys libraries: PyFluent-Parametric for parametric studies and PyFluent-Visualization for visualizing results.

* [PyFluent-Parametric documentation (PyAnsys)](https://parametric.fluent.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/)
* [PyFluent-Visualization documentation (PyAnsys)](https://visualization.fluent.docs.pyansys.com/)

The TUI is accessible within PyFluent, but with limitations. For more information, see [Using TUI commands](https://fluent.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/user_guide/legacy/tui.html) in the PyFluent documentation.
