## Fluent 

Ansys Fluent  comes with a GUI and a "TUI" (Text User Interface). This is written in a [dialect of Lisp called Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)).

* [TUI Documentation](https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/public/account/secured?returnurl=/Views/Secured/corp/v242/en/flu_ug/tgd_tcl_tui.html)

Fluent has an OSS Python interface in the form of PyFluent and is part of PyAnsys as well as two complementary support PyAnsys libraries: PyFluent-Parametric and PyFluent-Visualization. These are for parametric studies and visualizing results, respectively.

* [PyFluent-Parametric Docs (PyAnsys)](https://parametric.fluent.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/)
* [PyFluent-Visualization Docs (PyAnsys)](https://visualization.fluent.docs.pyansys.com/)

The TUI is accessible within PyFluent, but with caveats. You can read them here: [PyFluent TUI commands](https://fluent.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/user_guide/legacy/tui.html).

### Ansys Fluent Training Material 

There are not many developer-exclusive trainings available for Fluent, however, because Ansys Fluent includes the TUI, most Fluent courses include some TUI material.
