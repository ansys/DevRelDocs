# Meshing

While not an actual Ansys product collection, meshing products warrant their own page because of their usefulness. This page covers all of Ansys' meshing tools.

## Prime Mesh

Ansys Prime Mesh provides core Ansys meshing technology for building meshes of different types for various physics simulations.

* [PyPrimeMesh documentation (PyAnsys)](https://prime.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/)

Developers can interface with Prime Mesh through two options using the Ansys Prime Server:

* The open-source Ansys PyPrimeMesh Python client to access the meshing APIs
* The Ansys Prime Mesh Python client library available in the Ansys installation  

These two options have feature parity.
