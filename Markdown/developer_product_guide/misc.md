# Miscellaneous

This page covers all Ansys products that don';t neatly fit into a single product collection. Ansys System Coupling, for example, facilitates coupling of multiple solvers in a single solution and fits reasonably well into Structures, Electronics or Fluids, as a consequence.

## Workbench 

Ansys Workbench provides journaling capability in Python. The Python interpreter doubles up as a method of performing Python scripting within the application. There is also an interactive interpreter that can interactively interact with the application and a PyAnsys library: PyWorkbench.

## Multi-physics examples 

There are multi-physics examples being collated in a specific PyAnsys workflow repository.

[PyAnsys workflows Documentation (PyAnsys)](https://workflows.docs.pyansys.com/)

## System coupling

Ansys System Coupling has two main developer tools associated with it: the participant libraries and PySystemCoupling. The former are closed-source libraries available in multiple languages and the latter is an OSS library that's part of PyAnsys.

* [PySystemCoupling (PyAnsys)](https://systemcoupling.docs.pyansys.com/)

## Data Processing Framework (DPF) 

DPF is a Python library tool that's available within a lot of Ansys applications. DPF has multiple developer tools associated with it and includes a C++/C# client library, a Python Result Object accessed through ACT, and three PyAnsys libraries.

## Dynamic Reporting 

["Ansys Dynamic Reporting (ADR) is the report-generation, analytics, and data-storage framework integrated into the multiple Ansys products. It is a web-oriented collection of tools that allows you to bring all of your data together in one place, organize it, and create compelling reports for yourself, your engineers, your colleagues, and your customers."](https://nexusdemo.ensight.com/docs/en/html/Nexus.html)

There are two primary Ansys Dynamic Reporting Python interfaces and the PyAnsys OSS library PyDynamicReporting:

* [EnSight Python Ansys Dynamic Reporting API](https://nexusdemo.ensight.com/docs/en/html/EnSightPythonADRAPI.html)
  * Integrated into Ensight Python interpreter
* [External Python API](https://nexusdemo.ensight.com/docs/en/html/ExternalPythonAPI.html)
  * Can be used inside and out of the internal intepreter
* [PyDynamicReporting Docs (PyAnsys)](https://dynamicreporting.docs.pyansys.com/)

## Geometry 

The Ansys Geometry Service has an OSS PyAnsys library called PyAnsys Geometry.

## Prime Mesh 

Ansys Prime Mesh provides core Ansys meshing technology that can be used to build meshes of different types for various physics simulations.

* [Ansys Prime Mesh for developers](https://developer.ansys.com/docs/primemesh)
* [PyPrimeMesh Docs (PyAnsys)](https://prime.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/)

Developers can interface with Prime Mesh through two options using the Ansys Prime Server:

1. The open source Ansys PyPrimeMesh Python client to access the meshing APIs
2. The Ansys Prime Mesh Python client library available in the Ansys installation  

These two have feature parity.
