# Miscellaneous

This page covers all Ansys products that don't fit neatly into a single product collection. For example, Ansys System Coupling couples multiple solvers in a single solution and fits reasonably well into structures, electronics, or fluids.

## Workbench 

Ansys Workbench provides Python journaling capabilities. The Python interpreter enables Python scripting within the application. It also includes an interpreter that interacts with the application and PyWorkbench, an open-source PyAnsys library.

## System coupling

Ansys System Coupling provides two main developer tools: participant libraries and PySystemCoupling. The participant libraries are closed-source and available in multiple languages. PySystemCoupling is an open-source PyAnsys library.

## Dynamic Reporting 

Ansys Dynamic Reporting (ADR) is the report-generation, analytics, and data-storage framework integrated into multiple Ansys products. It is a web-oriented collection of tools you use to bring all your data together in one place, organize it, and create compelling reports for yourself, your engineers, your colleagues, and your customers.

There are two primary ADR Python interfaces and PyDynamicReporting, a PyAnsys OSS library.

* [EnSight Python Ansys Dynamic Reporting API](https://nexusdemo.ensight.com/docs/en/html/EnSightPythonADRAPI.html)
  * This API integrates into the Ensight Python interpreter.
* [External Python API](https://nexusdemo.ensight.com/docs/en/html/ExternalPythonAPI.html)
  * This external Python API is provided by the Python interpreter included in the CEI/Ansys distributions. It can be used inside and outside the internal interpreter.

## Prime Mesh 

Ansys Prime Mesh provides core Ansys meshing technology for building meshes of different types for various physics simulations.

* [Ansys Prime Mesh for developers (Developer Portal documentation)](https://developer.ansys.com/docs/primemesh)
* [PyPrimeMesh documentation (PyAnsys)](https://prime.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/)

Developers can interface with Prime Mesh through two options using the Ansys Prime Server:

* The open-source Ansys PyPrimeMesh Python client to access the meshing APIs
* The Ansys Prime Mesh Python client library available in the Ansys installation  

These two options have feature parity.
