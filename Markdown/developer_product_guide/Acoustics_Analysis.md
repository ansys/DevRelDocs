## Sound

Sound APIs for Active Sound Design for Electric Vehicles (ASDforEV), Car Sound Simulator (CSS), and Virtual Reality Sound (VRS) rely on the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol, which is delivered over User Datagram Protocol (UDP). This means that these APIs are independent of the operating system and language, even if Ansys Sound is  only available on Windows.

PyAnsys Sound APIs are available for Windows and Linux in Python. Note that the DPF server and DPF Sound plugin must run under Windows, and the client (the API) is available for both Linux and Windows.
