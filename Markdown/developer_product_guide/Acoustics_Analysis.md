Sound APIs for Active Sound Design for Electric Vehicles (ASDforEV), Car Sound Simulator (CSS), and Virtual Reality Sound (VRS) use the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol, which runs over User Datagram Protocol (UDP). These APIs work independently of the operating system and language, even though Ansys Sound is only available on Windows.

PyAnsys Sound APIs run on Windows and Linux in Python. The DPF Server and DPF Sound plugins must run on Windows, while the clients (APIs) work on both Linux and Windows.
