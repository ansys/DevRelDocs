# Electronics and Semiconductors

Ansys provides access to many electronics and semiconductor products through Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT). Subheadings include a `*` for products accessible through AEDT and a `+` for products available through AEDT and as standalone applications.

## AEDT

AEDT supports ACT Python scripting (including journaling) and the PyAEDT and PyEDB (Ansys Electronics Database) PyAnsys libraries. It also supports Visual Basic scripting alongside IronPython and CPython.
