# Electronics and Semiconductors

Unlike other Ansys products many Ansys electronics & semiconductor products are exposed through Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT). Products accessible through AEDT are marked with `*` below. Products that can be accessed through AEDT and as standalone applications are marked with `+`.

## Electronics Desktop 

The AEDT platform includes ACT Python scripting (including journaling) as well as the PyAEDT and PyEDB (Ansys Electronics Database) PyAnsys libraries. There has also been Visual Basic Scripting available alongside IronPython and CPython historically.
