# Mechanical API Documentation

The following documentation examines the APIs used in Ansys Mechanical. It provides descriptions
of the objects, methods, and properties for all namespaces used in the application.
The [Scripting in Mechanical Guide](https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/act_script/act_script.html)
contains similar information as the [ACT API Reference Guide](https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/act_ref/act_ref.html)
but provides practical examples of how you use the APIs in Mechanical, whereas the [ACT API Reference Guide](https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/act_ref/act_ref.html) and
the Mechanical API Documentation (this site) contain a complete listing of all supported APIs.
