 The Sensors REST API allows you to manage your Sensors Library, create new sensor assets or update existing ones, and download sensor assets as files.
 
 For details about sensor parameters, refer to the following sections of AVxcelerate Sensors Simulator User's Guide:

   - **Physics-Based Camera**
   - **Physics-Based LiDAR**
   - **Physics-Based Radar**
          
 To access the Sensors REST API, start the server using the script provided in the *Sensor_Labs_API* folder:

   - on Windows: `sensor-labs-api.ps1`
   - on Linux: `sensor-labs-api.sh`
          
An interactive version of the API documentation, with a Swagger interface, is available when running the script with the `start-doc` argument.
