# Postprocessing
optiSLang allows you to customize [postprocessing](https://ansysproducthelpqa.win.ansys.com/account/secured?returnurl=/Views/Secured/corp/v252/en/opti_ug/opti_ug_postprocessing.html). optiSLang postprocessing incorporates several default modes suitable for different monitoring purposes that can be fully customized using the Python interface. You can also create and use scripts to generate a postprocessing session and access and edit plots during a postprocessing session.

For more information about customizing the postprocessing, refer to the [Python Scripting](https://ansysproducthelpqa.win.ansys.com/account/secured?returnurl=/Views/Secured/corp/v252/en/opti_ug/opti_ug_python_scripting.html) section of the postprocessing documentation.
