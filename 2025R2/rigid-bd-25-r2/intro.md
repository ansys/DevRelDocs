# Introduction

The Rigid Dynamics solver uses an object-based approach that uses Python-based commands that follow Python syntax. This section explains this approach and the role of Python in rigid body commands. It also provides a library of commands for Rigid Body Dynamics (RBD) analyses (arranged by parent object) and examples of command usage.

An add-on is provided to facilitate the creation of complex joint and body loads that would otherwise require using Python command snippets. You can find information about how to load and use the add-on in the online help.
