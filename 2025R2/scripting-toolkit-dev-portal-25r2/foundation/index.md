# Foundation API

<a id="foundation-api"></a>

The Foundation API provides a low-level wrapper around the base functionality provided by the Server Layer SOAP API. As
a result, a detailed knowledge of the Service Layer SOAP API is required, and care is needed around managing request
size to achieve satisfactory performance and stability.

#### WARNING
The Foundation API is included for compatibility purposes only. The Streamlined API should be used for all new
solutions.

#### WARNING
The Foundation API does not follow Semantic Versioning. Breaking changes may be introduced with any release and will
in general not be documented.
