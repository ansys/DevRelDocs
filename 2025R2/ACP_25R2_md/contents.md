# Introduction

The Ansys Composite Prep™ (ACP) application is a preprocessor for defining and visualizing layered composite structures. It lets you create complex layups by modeling thin structures as shells and by supporting advanced solid modeling operations such as extruding shell models to solid models and mapping layup information onto existing solid models. Because ACP uses a ply-based approach, the layup definition remains stable even when the geometry or mesh changes. ACP also integrates with many third-party applications through the Composite CAE H5 interface.

The ACP scripting interface enables you to easily automate layup definitions, parameterize models, and interact with third-party Python packages.

To start using ACP through its Python API, see [Getting started](getting_started_acp.md).
