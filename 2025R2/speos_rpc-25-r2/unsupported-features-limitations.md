## Limitations

### Layer separation by source

Let's consider that you load, in the scene, a *.speos file that contains:
- supported sources by Speos RPC
- unsupported sources by Speos RPC (see list above)
- a sensor using the layer separation by source.
The order of sources in the layer list of the XMP generated out of Speos RPC job, and the order of source in the layer list of the XMP generated out of the *.speos are different.
Why does the order change? This is due to the unsupported sources by Speos RPC. The Speos RPC job reorders the sources, placing the unsupported sources first, then the supported sources in the layer list. As a consequence, the potential XML template generated out of the XMP (from the *.speos file) cannot be applied to the XMP (from the Speos RPC job).
