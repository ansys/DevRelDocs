# Introduction

This document contains the ModelCenter Remote Execution Java API.

## How this API document is organized
This API (Application Programming Interface) document has pages corresponding to the items in the navigation bar, described as follows.

### Overview

The [Overview](overview-summary.md) page is the front page of this API document and provides a list of all packages with a summary for each.  This page can also contain an overall description of the set of packages.

### Package

Each package has a page that contains a list of its classes and interfaces, with a summary for each. This page can contain six categories:

- Interfaces (italic)
- Classes
- Enums
- Exceptions
- Errors
- Annotation Types

### Class/interface

Each class, interface, nested class, and nested interface has its own separate page. Each of these pages has three sections consisting of a class/interface description, summary tables, and detailed member descriptions:

- **class/interface description**
    - Class inheritance diagram
    - Direct Subclasses
    - All Known Subinterfaces
    - All Known Implementing Classes
    - Class/interface declaration
    - Class/interface description
- **summary tables**
    - Nested Class Summary
    - Field Summary
    - Constructor Summary
    - Method Summary
- **detailed member descriptions**
    - Field Detail
    - Constructor Detail
    - Method Detail

Each summary entry contains the first sentence from the detailed description for that item. The summary entries are alphabetical, while the detailed descriptions are in the order they appear in the source code. This preserves the logical groupings established by the programmer.

### Annotation type

Each annotation type has its own separate page with the following sections:

- Annotation Type declaration
- Annotation Type description
- Required Element Summary
- Optional Element Summary
- Element Detail

### Enum

Each enum has its own separate page with the following sections:

- Enum declaration
- Enum description
- Enum Constant Summary
- Enum Constant Detail

### Tree (class hierarchy)

There is a [Class Hierarchy](overview-tree.md) page for all packages, plus a hierarchy for each package. Each hierarchy page contains a list of classes and a list of interfaces. The classes are organized by inheritance structure starting with `java.lang.Object`. The interfaces do not inherit from `java.lang.Object`.

### Deprecated API

The [Deprecated API](deprecated-list.md) page lists all of the API that have been deprecated. A deprecated API is not recommended for use, generally due to improvements, and a replacement API is usually given. Deprecated APIs may be removed in future implementations.

### Index

The [Index](index-all.md) contains an alphabetic list of all classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields.

### Serialized form

Each serializable or externalizable class has a description of its serialization fields and methods on the [Serialized Form](serialized-form.md) page. This information is of interest to re-implementors, not to developers using the API. While there is no link in the navigation bar, you can get to this information by going to any serialized class and clicking "Serialized Form" in the "See also" section of the class description.

### Constant field values

The [Constant Field Values](constant-values.md) page lists the static final fields and their values.
