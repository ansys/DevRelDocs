## Inputs


| Input | Name | Expected type(s) | Description |
|-------|-------|------------------|-------------|
| <strong>Pin 0</strong> | ip |[`string`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#string) | If no ip address is put, the local ip address is taken |
| <strong>Pin 1</strong> | port |[`string`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#string), [`int32`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#standard-types) | If no port is put, port 50052 is taken |
| <strong>Pin 2</strong> | starting_option |[`int32`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#standard-types) | default is 1 that starts server in new thread. With 0, this thread will be waiting for grpc calls and will not be usable for anything else. With 2, it the server will be started in a new process. |
| <strong>Pin 3</strong> | should_start_server |[`bool`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#standard-types) | If true, the server is assumed to be local and is started. If false, only a client (able to send grpc calls) will be started |
| <strong>Pin 4</strong> | data_sources |[`data_sources`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#data-sources) | A data source with result key 'grpc' and file path 'port:ip' can be used instead of the input port and IP. |
| <strong>Pin 5</strong> | dpf_context |[`string`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#string), [`int32`](../../core-concepts/dpf-types.md#standard-types) | This pin is associated with pin(2) = 2 (server started in a new process). User can enter the integer associated with a DPF context (1: Standalone Context - DpfCoreStandalone.xml, 3: Custom - DpfCustomDefined.xml) or a string with the path of the XML specifying the context.  |
