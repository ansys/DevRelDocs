# Version 2025 R2

**Version 2025 R2 (V252)** introduces several important changes and enhancements across the API, materials, and user interface (UI) components. These updates improve consistency, support new capabilities, and remove deprecated or redundant functionality:

## Custom Tree

-   **Dynamic Rebuild Control**: Two new API methods allow you to control tree rebuild behavior for performance enhancement:
    -   **SetCommandCompleteRebuild(false)** prevents automatic tree rebuilding after every command. To revert to automatic rebuilding, use **SetCommandCompleteRebuild(true)**.
    -   **RebuildCustomTree()** must be manually called after tree changes (for example: add/delete).
-   **Tree Property Enhancements**: Three new **ITreeHierarchy** properties improve custom tree definition:
    - **Index**: Allows multiple custom trees to be ordered.
    - **GetTreeGroup** and **GetTreeToolTip**: Optional functions to define grouping and tooltips dynamically. Both accept null.

## Materials

-   **Material Coordinate System Assignment**
    -   **UseLocalCoordinateSystem** and **UseGlobalCoordinateSystem** properties have moved from the **Material** to the **MaterialAssignment** level. This enables the same material to be reused with different orientations across assignments.
-   **Beam Material Name Updates**
    -   Beam materials now include thickness in their names for uniqueness (for example: S355 → Structural Steel, S355 (10 < t ≤ 16)).
    -   Migration support added to ensure older projects reflect the new naming convention.
    -   Material matching logic now uses name and source instead of identifier for beam materials, except in local libraries.

## Meshing

-   **New Registration Methods**
    -   Two new methods were introduced for mesh handling:
        -   **RegisterMesh()**
        -   **RegisterFarFieldMesh()**

## Result Variables

-   **Renamed and Removed Variables**
    -   **ResultLabel** → **ResultSetLabel**
    -   **ResultPlotID** → **ResultSetID**
    -   **ResultVariable.OperatingPressure** → **ResultVariable.FanPressureRise** (to match documentation)
    -   **ResultVariable.LocalReactionForce: Removed**
    -   **ResultVariable.ReactionResultant** → **ResultVariable.ReactionForce**
These changes improve consistency and better align the API with user-facing documentation and UI.

## Internal Fans

-   **Volume-Flow Curve Support**
    -   Internal fans now support volume-flow curve definitions in both **Explore** and **Refine stages**.
    -   New UI options include:
        -   Definition dropdown
        -   Volume flow table
        -   Hub and tip radius inputs (used for filtering)
        -   Informational display
    -   Includes support for local libraries and a default **IcePak** library.
-   **Namespace Refactor**
    -   Internal fans were moved from the **Conditions** namespace to a new **InternalFans** namespace.

## User Interface

-   **UI Refactoring**
    -   Several minor UI-related items were moved to the **UserInterface** project to reduce clutter.

## API Clean-Up and Refactoring

-   **Notifications Class Consolidation**
    -   The **Notifications** class has been removed. Static methods were relocated to the **Notification** class.
-   **Code Cleanup**
    -   Typos corrected in method names.
    -   Removed a faulty property setter to improve stability.
    -   Use of the contextual value keyword was enforced for property set accessors.

## SpaceClaim Integration

-   **ACIS Export Options**
    -   **AcisExportOptions.Version** property was removed. Only V5 remains in AcisVersion, as all other versions are no longer supported.

## API Changes and Incompatibilities

-   **Breaking Changes**
    -   Removal of **BeamProfileProperties.SurfaceAreaPerLength**
    -   Removal of **ResultVariable.LocalReactionForce**
    -   Renaming of multiple result variables
    -   Reassignment of coordinate system properties
    -   Namespace relocation of internal fan support
